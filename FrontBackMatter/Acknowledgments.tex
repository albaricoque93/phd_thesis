\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
The collective nature of scientific research has never been more evident to me than during my Ph.D. This thesis would not exist without the continuous support of the people around me.

Thanks to Daniel for giving me the opportunity to work with him and for his guidance during these three years. I am also very grateful to my co-supervisors, Margie and Andrew, for your feedback and support. I am in debt with my co-authors, as this thesis contains many of their contributions. Thanks to members of the Stouffer and Tylianakis lab, it has been an honor being your colleague.  Thanks to Fernando and Kate for being fantastic co-workers and friends.

Thanks to all of the people in New Zealand and Australia that became family.  Thanks to Luke for being a loving and caring partner; this thesis is proof of your never-ending support.

Last but not least, I am forever grateful to my parents Rosalva and Francisco. Su apoyo y amor incondicional hicieron todo esto posible. Gracias pap√°s.
