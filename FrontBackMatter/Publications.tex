\chapter*{Preface} % Publications page text
This thesis is a collection of three stand alone scientific articles. Each chapter is a standalone piece of research and, therefore, I only provide a general Introduction and Conclusion chapters linking the three chapters together. In  \autoref{Intro} I focus on describing how my three chapters are connected. In  \autoref{Discussion} I focus on summarising the results from each of my thesis chapters, their combined implications both in both how we study interactions and their consequences for diversity maintenance and finally I further expand on new ideas beyond those presented in the different chapters to discuss about the future steps moving forward.


At the time of submission, each of these three articles are in different stages of the publication process and are formatted in the style of a journal article.

\autoref{Bee_foraging}: ``The context dependency of pollinator interference: how environmental conditions and co-foraging species impact floral visitaion'' was published on May 2021 in the journal of  \textit{Ecology Letters} in volume .

\autoref{Bayesian_competition}: ``The interplay of environmental conditions, parameter sensitivity and structural sensitivity in predictions of species coexistence'' is in preparation for submission to \textit{Ecology Letters}.

\autoref{Coexistence_alleles}: ``Coexistence of sexually antagonistic alleles: insights of Modern Coexistence Theory into the maintenance of genetic diversity'' is in preparation for submission to \textit{The American Naturalist}.
