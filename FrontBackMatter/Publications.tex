This thesis is a collection of three stand alone scientific articles. Each chapter is a standalone piece of research and, therefore, I only provide a general Introduction and Conclusion chapters linking the three chapters together. In  I focus on describing how my three chapters are connected. In  Discussion, I focus on summarising the results from each of my thesis chapters, their combined implications both in invasion ecology and data science and finally I further expand on new ideas beyond those presented in the different chapters to discuss about the future steps moving forward.

At the time of submission, each of these three articles are in different stages of the publication process and are formatted in the style of a journal article. 
This chapter  is in preparation for  submission to \textit{Journal of Applied Ecology}. 
This chapter  was published in 
the \textit{Journal of Applied Ecology} April 2021: Volume 58, no. 4, pages 777--788. 
This chapter is in preparation for submission to the \textit{Journal of the Royal Society Interface}.
