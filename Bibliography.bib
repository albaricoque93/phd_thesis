	abstract     = {Coexistence between plant species is well known to depend on the outcomes of species interactions within an environmental context. The incorporation of environmental variation into empirical studies of coexistence are rare, however, due to the complex experiments needed to do so and the lack of feasible modelling approaches for determining how environmental factors alter specific coexistence mechanisms. In this article, we present a simple modelling framework for assessing how variation in species interactions across environmental gradients impact on niche overlap and fitness differences, two core determinants of coexistence. We use a novel formulation of an annual plant population dynamics model that allows for competitive and facilitative species interactions and for variation in the strength and direction of these interactions across environmental gradients. Using this framework, we examine outcomes of plant–plant interactions between four commonly co-occurring annual plant species from Western Australian woodlands. We then determine how niche overlap and fitness differences between these species vary across three environmental gradients previously identified as important for structuring diversity patterns in this system: soil phosphorus, shade and water. We found facilitation to be a widespread phenomenon and that interactions between most species pairs shift between competitive and facilitative across multiple environmental gradients. Environmental conditions also altered the strength, direction and relative variation of both niche overlap and fitness differences in nonlinear and unpredictable ways. Synthesis. We provide a simple framework for incorporating environmental heterogeneity into explorations of coexistence mechanisms. Our findings highlight the importance of the environment in determining the outcome of species interactions and the potential for pairwise coexistence between species. The prevalence of facilitation in our system indicates a need to improve current theoretical frameworks of coexistence to include noncompetitive interactions and ways of translating these effects into explicit predictions of coexistence. Our study also suggests a need for further research into determining which factors result in consistent responses of niche overlap and fitness differences to environmental variation. Such information will improve our ability to predict outcomes of coexistence, invasion events and responses of whole communities to future environmental change.},

	abstract     = {Ecologists have identified a growing number of functional traits that promote invasion. However, whether trait differences between exotic and native species promote invasion success by enhancing niche differences or giving invaders competitive advantages is poorly understood. We explored the mechanisms by which phenology determines invasion success in a California annual plant community by quantifying how the seasonal timing of growth relates to niche differences that stabilize coexistence, and the competitive ability differences that drive dominance and exclusion. We parameterized models of community dynamics from experimentally assembled annual communities in which exotic plants displayed earlier, coincident, or later phenology than native residents. Using recent theoretical advances from the coexistence literature, we found that differences in phenology promote stabilizing niche differences between exotic and native species. However, phenology was more strongly related to competitive ability differences, allowing later invaders to outcompete earlier native competitors and native residents to outcompete earlier invaders in field experiments. Few of these insights could be inferred by comparing the competitive outcomes across invaders, highlighting the need to quantify niche and competitive ability differences when disentangling how species differences drive invasion success.},

These still largely untested predictions complicate Darwin's hypothesis that more closely related species less easily coexist, and challenge the use of community phylogenetic patterns to infer competition. We field parameterised models of competitor dynamics with pairs of 18 California annual plant species, and then related species' niche and fitness differences to their phylogenetic distance. Stabilising niche differences were unrelated to phylogenetic distance, while species' average fitness showed phylogenetic structure. This meant that more distant relatives had greater competitive asymmetry, which should favour the coexistence of close relatives. Nonetheless, coexistence proved unrelated to phylogeny, due in part to increasing variance in fitness differences with phylogenetic distance, a previously overlooked property of such relationships. Together, these findings question the expectation that distant relatives should more readily coexist.},

This method yields broad conclusions that are independent of the details of a model. It is used here to show that mechanisms of coexistence and competitive exclusion are largely restricted to three broad categories. One of these categories includes classical mechanisms that do not depend on fluctuations over time. Another category includes mechanisms which may be referred to collectively as the storage effect. These mechanisms involve species-specific responses to environmental fluctuations, a relationship between fluctuations in competition and fluctuations in the environment, and an interaction between environment and competition. The final category depends on fluctuating competition and nonlinear responses to competition that differ between species. These general results are illustrated with analyses of several specific models, including a Lotka-Volterra model, a model of nonlinear resource consumption, and models of recruitment fluctuations for iteroparous organisms and for annual plants.},

(2) Experimental pollination showed that c. 150 pollen grains per flower were required to achieve the average natural full seed-set in the plant population. Although 57\% of the flower-visiting moths deposited pollen, only about 10\% of the moth visits delivered ⩽ 150 pollen grains in one visit to virgin female flowers, indicating that seed-set usually originated from multiple pollinator visits. (3) Pollen receipt indicated pollination by a guild of noctuid and sphingid moths. The abundance of the dominating pollinator species varied strongly between years. (4) Most species deposited about the same mean number of pollen grains, although they were taxonomically diverse and had different flower-visiting behaviours and proboscis lengths. Even noctuid moths of the genus Hadena, known as associated larval seed predators of S. vulgaris, were not especially frequent or efficient pollinators despite the fact that these moths influence their larval food resource through pollination. (5) The annual and seasonal variation in abundance among pollinator species and lack of variation in pollination efficiency among them are factors which counteract specializational trends and control evolutionary retention of plastic and unspecialized floral traits in S. vulgaris. They thereby provide an option for opportunistic responses in this species.]}

	abstract     = {Predicting the dynamics of natural food webs requires estimates of the strength of interactions among species. The ability to estimate per capita interaction strength from observational data is desirable because of the logistical difficulty of using experimental manipulations to obtain such measures for all species within complex natural communities. In this paper, I derive observational measures of per capita interaction strength having units matching those of dynamic food web models (per capita consumption and assimilation rates). I also highlight the difference between per capita interaction strength (a parameter used in theoretical models) and species impact (empirical measures of total species effect). I then use behavioral observations and population censuses in a rocky intertidal community to estimate both per capita interaction strengths and species impacts on invertebrate prey of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), American Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), and Northwestern Crows (Corvus caurinus). Estimated per capita interaction strengths exhibited a skewed distribution with many weak interactions and few strong interactions: mean ± 1 sd of log10(interaction strength) = −1.95 ± 1.40 (bird-day/m of shore)−1. Per capita interaction strength correlated poorly (r2 = 0.152–0.157) and nonlinearly with both consumption rates and percentage contribution of a prey species to the diet. Using my observational estimates of per capita interaction strengths, I predicted the species impact of bird predation on different prey taxa. Predictions included strong effects of birds on goose barnacles (Pollicipes polymerus), limpets (Lottia and Tectura spp.), sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus spp.), and large starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides and Solaster stimpsoni), but little effect on mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus), dogwhelk snails (Nucella spp.), and acorn barnacles (Semibalanus cariosus). I compared nine of the predictions with 126 results of experimental manipulations of birds. The predictions agreed both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental results. These findings suggest that observational measures of interaction strength that have units matching those of dynamical food web models may be reasonable to use in estimating those found in natural communities.},

Since 1959, Holling's prey-dependent Type II functional response, a model that is a function of prey abundance only, has served as the basis for a large literature on predator–prey theory. We present statistical evidence from 19 predator–prey systems that three predator-dependent functional responses (Beddington-DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin, and Hassell-Varley), i.e., models that are functions of both prey and predator abundance because of predator interference, can provide better descriptions of predator feeding over a range of predator–prey abundances. No single functional response best describes all of the data sets. Given these functional forms, we suggest use of the Beddington-DeAngelis or Hassell-Varley model when predator feeding rate becomes independent of predator density at high prey density and use of the Crowley-Martin model when predator feeding rate is decreased by higher predator density even when prey density is high.},

Contrary to this claim, I argue that such “ratio—dependent” functional responses are very unlikely to occur on theoretical grounds and have not been shown empirically. Previous justifications for ratio—dependent functional responses ignore the role of these responses in determining prey population dynamics. Patterns in the abundances of trophic levels and experimental results that have been cited as support for “ratio—dependent” predation are consistent with numerous other explanations. These other explanation do not suffer from the pathological behaviors and lack of a plausible mechanism that afflict ratio—dependent models. Furthermore, ratio—dependent functional responses, because of their lack of mechanistic basis, do not provide a good basis for developing more detailed models. Nor can the use of ratio—dependent models be justified as a limiting case of more general predator—dependent models.},

Although existing evidence supports this assumption for the effect of animals on plants, no studies have evaluated it for the reciprocal effect of plants on animals. We evaluate this assumption using data on the reproductive effects of pollinators on plants and the reciprocal reproductive effects of plants on pollinators. The magnitude of species impacts of plants on pollinators, the reciprocal impacts of pollinators on plants, and their asymmetry were well predicted by interaction frequency. However, interaction strength was a key determinant of the sign of species impacts. These results underscore the importance of quantifying interaction strength in studies of mutualistic networks. We also show that the distributions of interaction strengths and species impacts are highly skewed, with few strong and many weak interactions. This skewed distribution matches the pattern observed in food webs, suggesting that the community-wide organization of species interactions is fundamentally similar between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Our results have profound ecological implications, given the key role of interaction strength for community stability.},

In this paper the role of biodiversity in securing crop protection and soil fertility is explored in detail.

For example, two resources which are nutritionally perfectly substitutable may be operationally switching, antagonistic, or complementary because of spatial heterogeneity. A graphical, equilibrium theory of resource competition allows prediction of the outcome of interactions between several consumers for the various classes of resources. The technique requires information on (1) resource type (growth isoclines), (2) resource preference, (3) resource supply processes, and (4) mortality rates for all species. For all resource types, the major criterion for stable coexistence is that each species consume relatively more of the one resource which more limits its own growth rate.},

This paper presents other possible mathematical models of competition between species, and gives the results of experiments designed to test the validity of such models. Eight of the ten new models presented contain the Lotka-Volterra model as a special case. The experiments made to test the models are of two kinds. Type 1 experiments are continuous one- or two-species populations, which permit the estimation of the carrying capacity of each species and the numbers of the two species at the point of stable equilibrium. Type 2 experiments measure the change in numbers over a short time interval in populations started with many different initial densities of the two species. Type 2 experiments give information on the dynamics of the two-species system in the phase plane whose coordinates are the number of individuals of each species. The models accounting best for the results are models five and seven (Table II). Each of these two models contains one parameter more than the Lotka-Volterra model. Model five adds a nonlinear term of self-interaction (−βiN2i). Model seven has the form, dNi/dt = riN/Kθii(Kθii − Nθii − αijNj1−θii). The exponential parameter θ removes the restriction of the logistic theory of population growth, that each individual added to the population decrease the rate of growth of the population by a constant amount. With model seven the rate of growth of a population of a single species need not have its maximum at K2, that is when the number of individuals is half the carrying capacity of the environment.},

Types of mechanism: The mechanisms can be divided into those that are stabilizing, i.e. with an increase-when-rare mechanism, and those that are equalizing, the latter on their own only delaying the exclusion of species. However, by evening out fitness, equalizing mechanisms can facilitate the operation of stabilizing mechanisms. Importance: It is suggested that circular interference networks, co-evolution of similar interference ability, cyclic succession, equal chance (neutrality) and initial patch composition are likely to be unimportant, or perhaps not even occur. Equal chance is an equalizing mechanism. Allogenic disturbance, alpha-niche differentiation, environmental fluctuation (relative non-linearity and/or the storage effect) and pest pressure are probably important. All four are stabilizing. More evidence is needed on aggregation, interference/dispersal trade-offs and the spatial mass effect. Aggregation and the spatial mass effect are equalizing. Suggestions are made of the evidence needed to make informed judgements on which contribute the most to co-existence in plant communities.},

	abstract     = {Thirty-five percent of global production from crops including at least 800 cultivated plants depend on animal pollination. The transformation of agriculture in the past half-century has triggered a decline in bees and other insect pollinators. In North America, losses of bee colonies have accelerated since 2004, leaving the continent with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the past 50 years. A number of factors linked to industrial modes of agriculture affect bee colonies and other pollinators around the world, ranging from habitat degradation due to monocultures with consequent declines in flowering plants and the use of damaging insecticides. Incentives should be offered to farmers to restore pollinator-friendly habitats, including flower provisioning within or around crop fields and elimination of use of insecticides by adopting agroecological production methods. Conventional farmers should be extremely cautious in the choice, timing, and application of insecticides and other chemicals. Here, we review the literature providing mounting evidence that the restoration of plant biodiversity within and around crop fields can improve habitat for domestic and wild bees as well as other insects and thus enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Main findings are the following: (1) certain weed species within crop fields that provide food resources and refuge should be maintained at tolerable levels within crop fields to aid in the survival of viable populations of pollinators. (2) Careful manipulation strategies need to be defined in order to avoid weed competition with crops and interference with certain cultural practices. Economic thresholds of weed populations, as well as factors affecting crop–weed balance within a crop season, need to be defined for specific cropping systems. (3) More research is warranted to advance knowledge on identifying beneficial weed species and ways to sponsor them to attract pollinators while not reducing yields through interference. (4) In areas of intensive farming, field margins, field edges and paths, headlands, fence-lines, rights of way, and nearby uncultivated patches of land are important refuges for many pollinators. (5) Maintenance and restoration of hedgerows and other vegetation features at field borders is therefore essential for harboring pollinators. (6) Appropriate management of non-cropped areas to encourage wild pollinators may prove to be a cost-effective means of maximizing crop yield.},

	abstract     = {The detection and significance of higher order interactions (HOIs) between species has been a matter of debate and experimentation in community ecology for several decades. HOIs are considered potentially significant because their presence is assumed to mean that the dynamic behavior of a full community of species is unpredictable based on observations of interactions between subsets of the species within the community. Despite such attention, the causal mechanisms that produce HOIs have been inadequately discussed. We discuss three different usages of the term HOIs and provide insight as to why HOIs might be found within a given community. HOIs may be detected for three reasons: inappropriate assumptions made concerning species interactions that influence statistical tests, unmeasured parameters and variables, and interaction modifications (i.e., a functional change in the interaction of two species caused by a third species. This confusion concerning the defining attributes of HOIs has made their detection problematic. While the statistical tests being used in the ecological experiments to detect HOIs are described in detail in most papers, the dynamic models underlying these tests are often not made explicit. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalency of three different statistical tests: the Case and Bender (1981) test, analysis of variance, and a multiplicative test (Wootton 1994). However, the choice of a response variable (i.e., population densities, population growth rates, per—capita growth rates, etc.) and different data transformations applied to these response variables alter the underlying dynamics model that is being tested. The result is that the statistical test applied does not always perform the intended comparison but instead tests a different and sometimes unjustified or even inappropriate dynamic model. Finally, we review the relationship between indirect effects and HOIs. Whereas some researchers have lumped HOIs and indirect effects, we argue that the two represent completely unique and separate phenomena. Additionally, indirect effects can complicate detection of HOIs, and we review several methods by which to separate the two processes.},

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer–resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

In classic population genetics models, difficulties arise if fitnesses depend on interactions with others. Two approaches - ‘trait group’ methods, and game theory - are discussed. If the interacting individuals are relatives, there is again a choice between the exact ‘neighbour-modulated fitness’ approach and the more intuitive ‘inclusive fitness’ method. A more drastic change in the nature of the model arises if the units of the evolving system are not individual organisms, but either genes or species.

Mathematical equations that govern the distribution of organisms were first discovered and developed during the 1960s. The mindset of the engineer is that we can learn from nature. This motivates the application of biogeography to optimization problems. Just as the mathematics of biological genetics inspired the development of genetic algorithms (GAs), and the mathematics of biological neurons inspired the development of artificial neural networks, this paper considers the mathematics of biogeography as the basis for the development of a new field: biogeography-based optimization (BBO). We discuss natural biogeography and its mathematics, and then discuss how it can be used to solve optimization problems. We see that BBO has features in common with other biology-based optimization methods, such as GAs and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This makes BBO applicable to many of the same types of problems that GAs and PSO are used for, namely, high-dimension problems with multiple local optima. However, BBO also has some features that are unique among biology-based optimization methods. We demonstrate the performance of BBO on a set of 14 standard benchmarks and compare it with seven other biology-based optimization algorithms. We also demonstrate BBO on a real-world sensor selection problem for aircraft engine health estimation.},

The goal of this paper is to reveal the shortcomings of this “philosophy” of mathematical modelling and to outline a more promising strategy for creating models. It recommends choosing “patterns” actually existing in ecological systems, rather than questions of a general nature, as a point of departure for conceptual models. In this way, the advantages of conceptual models can be utilized without having to relinquish the testability of the hypotheses proposed with the aid of the models.},

This notwithstanding, the challenge of understanding more complex systems has repeatedly generated interest in the role of so-called higher-order interactions (HOIs) imposed by species beyond the focal pair. Here we argue that HOIs – defined as non-additive effects of density on per capita growth – are best interpreted as emergent properties of phenomenological models (e.g. Lotka–Volterra competition) rather than as distinct ‘ecological processes’ in their own right. Using simulations of consumer-resource models, we explore the mechanisms and system properties that give rise to HOIs in observational data. We demonstrate that HOIs emerge under all but the most restrictive of assumptions, and that incorporating non-additivity into phenomenological models improves the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of model predictions. Notably, we also observe that HOIs derive primarily from mechanisms and system properties that apply equally to single-species or pairwise systems as they do to more diverse communities. Consequently, there exists a strong mandate for further recognition of non-additive effects in both theoretical and empirical research.},

	abstract     = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1085–1093 Abstract Though many processes are involved in determining which species coexist and assemble into communities, competition is among the best studied. One hypothesis about competition’s contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

Measuring interaction strength is difficult because of the large number of interactions in any natural system, long-term feedback, multiple pathways of effects between species pairs, and possible nonlinearities in interaction-strength functions. Presently, the few studies that extensively estimate interaction strength suggest that distributions of interaction strength tend to be skewed toward few strong and many weak interactions. Modeling studies indicate that such skewed patterns tend to promote system stability and arise during assembly of persistent communities. Methods for estimating interaction strength efficiently from traits of organisms, such as allometric relationships, show some promise. Methods for estimating community response to environmental perturbations without an estimate of interaction strength may also be of use. Spatial and temporal scale may affect patterns of interaction strength, but these effects require further investigation and new multispecies modeling frameworks. Future progress will be aided by development of long-term multispecies time series of natural communities, by experimental tests of different methods for estimating interaction strength, and by increased understanding of nonlinear functional forms.},

	abstract     = {We give a comprehensive review of Chesson's coexistence theory, summarizing, for the first time, all its fundamental details in one single document. Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

	abstract     = {Bumblebees were introduced into New Zealand from the UK approximately 120 years ago and four species became established. Two of these, Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum, are common in Europe whilst two, B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus, have experienced declines, and the latter is now extinct in the UK. The presence of these species in New Zealand presents an opportunity to study their ecology in a contrasting environment. Forage visits made by bumblebees in New Zealand were recorded across a season. Ninety-six percent of visits were to six non-native forage plants (Cirsium vulgare, Echium vulgare, Hypericum perforatum, Lotus corniculatus, Lupinus polyphyllus and Trifolium pratense). All but L. polyphyllus are European plant species, and three are noxious weeds in New Zealand. Several of these plants have decreased in abundance in the UK, providing a potential explanation for the declines of B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus in Britain. In contrast to studies conducted elsewhere, B. ruderatus, B. terrestris and B. hortorum did not differ in diet breadth and overlap in forage use was high, probably due to the reduced diversity of bumblebee forage plants present in New Zealand. Diel partitioning of forage use between the species was observed, with foraging activity of B. hortorum greatest in the morning and evening, B. ruderatus greatest in the middle of the day and B. terrestris intermediate between the two. These patterns correspond to the climatic preferences of each species as evidenced by their geographic ranges. Implications for bumblebee conservation in the UK are discussed.},

However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at diVerent spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess speciWc foraging ranges, diVerent spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the eVects of the landscape-wide availability of diVerent resources (mass Xowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250–3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass Xowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest eVects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly inXuenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal signiWcance) at a small spatial scale (250 m).},

Using empirically derived critical values for the ratio of mean squared distance between successive observations to mean squared distance from the center of activity, we demonstrate a bivariate test of the independence assumption first proposed by Schoener. For cases in which the null hypothesis of independence is rejected, we present a procedure for determining the time interval at which autocorrelation becomes negligible. To illustrate implementation of the test, locational data obtained from a ratio—tagged adult female cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) were used. The test can be used to design an efficient sampling schedule for movement studies, and it is also useful in revealing behavioral phenomena such as home range shifting and any tendency of animals to follow prescribed routes in their daily activities. Further, the test may provide a means of examining how an animal's use of space is affected by its internal clock.},

Although competition and predation are known to act simultaneously in communities, theory and empirical study of the two processes continue to be developed independently. Here, we integrate modern coexistence theory and food web theory to simultaneously quantify the relative importance of predation, competition, and environmental fluctuations for species coexistence. We first examine coexistence in a classic multi-trophic model, adding complexity to the food web using a novel machine learning approach. We then apply our framework to a parameterized rocky intertidal food web model, partitioning empirical coexistence dynamics. We find that both environmental fluctuation and variation in predation contribute substantially to species coexistence. Unexpectedly, covariation in these two forces tends to destabilize coexistence, leading to new insights about the role of bottom-up versus top-down forces in both theory and the rocky intertidal ecosystem.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.},

	abstract     = {Most textbook treatments imply, and almost all theoretical analyses assume, that mutualistic interactions take place between a single pair of interacting partner species. A major goal of this symposium is to broaden and shift this pairwise perspective and make it concordant with the emerging view that locally exclusive mutualisms between just two species are the exception and that many communities include guilds of mutualistic species on one or both sides of the interaction. Many pollination and seed‐dispersal mutualisms have long been recognized as diffuse, but recent molecular analyses are revealing unrecognized partner diversity in mutualistic interactions previously thought to be locally species specific. Co‐occurring species within a mutualist guild are unlikely to be ecologically equivalent in the way they locate, compete for, and/or reward partners, and so intraguild interactions have the potential to influence population dynamics and patterns of selection in species on both sides of the mutualistic interaction. To illustrate some of these potential complexities for population dynamics, I use simple path analytic models to show that positive pairwise interactions between mutualists do not necessarily translate into positive net interactions within a mutualism involving more than two species. For example, when there is intraguild competition for partners, or even for resources external to the mutualism, the presence of a lower‐quality mutualist can negatively affect the partner population by reducing associations it can form with better mutualists. Variation in quality among potential partners is likely to place a premium on traits or behaviors that enhance association with better mutualists. More investigations are needed to determine how variation among interacting mutualists, with respect to characteristics such as longevity, dispersal capability, and competitive ability, influence population dynamics and selection in multispecies mutualisms.},

	abstract     = {Real world ecosystems (as opposed to their mathematical counterparts) are often enormously complex associations of species which interact in diverse ways. As a matter of practical necessity, field ecologists can rarely specify, much less quantify, all of the interactions. Consequently, empirically derived equations purporting to describe the dynamics of such systems generally consider fewer than the total number of interacting species. The present paper calls attention to this reduction in dimensionality and explores some of its consequences. In particular, attention is called to what are termed the Abstracted Growth Equations, those of reduced dimensionality, and to the way that these expressions derive from the underlying n—variable equations. The degree to which the Abstracted Equations accurately describe the dynamics of the species of interest is shown to depend on the time scale of these species relative to that of the species which are omitted. A general result relating the product of the eigenvalues of the Abstracted Equations to the corresponding product for the n—variable equations is proved. It is further pointed out that the distinction between Abstracted and n—variable equations suggests experiments which at least in principle should enable the empiricist to estimate the importance of species and interactions which are omitted. The relationship between Abstracted and n—variable equations is also discussed with regard to measuring competition coefficients and related parameters, and also to the problem of determining whether or not higher order interactions are present in laboratory microcosms. The analysis concludes by comparing the stability properties of several simplified models of community interactions with those of the corresponding one—species Abstracted Equations. It is shown, for the case of difference equations, in particular, that analysis of the one—species models may often lead one to conclude that the system is stable, whereas in fact it is unstable due to overdamping. The final Discussion relates the results of the present paper to previous studies that anticipate the view presented here, and comments on the quarrel that has developed between those ecologists who believe in the existence of community—wide patterns of body size and the like and those who reject this view. It is suggested that the resolution of this dispute may depend on our ability to classify subsystems of species (i.e., guilds) with regard to the extent to which their internal organization is influenced by variation in the larger communities in which they are embedded. Finally, it is shown that Roughgarden's principal results for community coevolution can be deduced from the Abstracted Growth Equations of a particular subset of the entire community.},

	abstract     = {ConclusionsBiology above the level of the individual organism — population ecology and genetics, community ecology, biogeography and evolution — requires the study of intrinsically complex systems. But the dominant philosophies of western science have proven to be inadequate for the study of complexity:(1) The reductionist myth of simplicity leads its advocates to isolate parts as completely as possible and study these parts. It underestimates the importance of interactions in theory, and its recommendations for practice (in agricultural programs or conservation and environmental protection) are typically thwarted by the power of indirect and unanticipated causes rather than by error in the detailed description of their own objects of study. (2) Reductionism ignores properties of complex wholes; the effects of these properties are therefore seen only as noise; this randomness is elevated into an ontological principle which leads to the blocking of investigation and the reification of statistics, so that data reduction and statistical prediction often pass for explanation. (3) The faith in the atomistic nature of the world makes the allocation of relative weights to separate causes the main object of science, and makes it more difficult to study the nature of interconnectedness. Where simple behaviors emerge out of complex interactions, it takes that simplicity to deny the complexity; where the behavior is bewilderingly complex it reifies its own confusion into a denial of regularity.Both the internal theoretical needs of ecology and the social demands that it inform our planned interactions with nature require an ecology that makes the understanding of complexity the central problem: it must cope with interdependence and relative autonomy, with similarity and difference, with the general and the particular, with chance and necessity, with equilbrium and change, with continuity and discontinuity, with contradictory processes. It must become increasingly self-conscious of its own philosophy, and that philosophy will be effective to the extent that it becomes not only materialist, but dialectical.},

We conducted a field study in Mediterranean annual grasslands to parameterise population models of six competing plant species. Spatially explicit floral visitor assemblages and soil salinity variation were characterised for each species. Both floral visitors and soil salinity modified species population dynamics via direct changes in seed production and indirect changes in competitive responses. Although the magnitude and sign of these changes were species-specific, floral visitors promoted coexistence at neighbourhood scales, while soil salinity did so over larger scales by changing the superior competitors’ identity. Our results show how below and aboveground interactions maintain diversity in heterogeneous landscapes through their opposing effects on the determinants of competitive outcomes.},

Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world. Even in a diverse Amazonian forest, trees show particular leaf characteristics that indicate that they are subtly specialized for habitat and growth strategy.

	abstract     = {I tested for an association between intraspecific size differences and differences in resource utilization in worker bumble bees (Bombus ternarius and B. pennsylvanicus). Bees were observed foraging in two fields in Minnesota where flower species with short corollas and species with long corollas occurred in both single—species and mixed—species stands. In mixed—species stands, foragers on the species with short corollas were found to have shorter proboscides than conspecific foragers on the species with long corollas. However, proboscis lengths of foragers on the species with a long corolla in single—species stands did not differ from those on the species with a short corolla in single—species stands. Thus, where a choice exists, bumble bee foragers select the species having a corolla most compatible to their proboscis length. I then compared conspecific foragers on a single flower species in one—species versus mixed—species stands. For foragers on flowering species with a short corolla, proboscis length was significantly shorter in the mixed—species than in the single—species stand, but this difference was not found for the species with a long corolla. Thus, presence of other flowering species can influenced the pollinator population of a species, relative to a single—species stand. Resource choice by foragers was analyzed using a probability function, calculated as the ratio of foragers with a given proboscis length on the species with a long corolla to the number with that proboscis length collected on both species. The shape of the probability function was fitted to a sigmoidal curve using probit analysis Regression of the linearized probabilities was significant. This procedure is a better measure of intra— or interspecies association than are measures such as niche overlap, because it quantifies a continuous distribution and accounts for variance in the species distribution.},

Among the major difficulties impeding model development and implementation are the sensitivity of outcomes to variations in model parameters, the problem of choosing of particular expressions for the parametrization of functional relations, and difficulties in validating models using laboratory data and/or field observations. In this paper, we revisit the phenomenon which is referred to as structural sensitivity of a model. Structural sensitivity arises as a result of the interplay between sensitivity of model outcomes to variations in parameters and sensitivity to the choice of model functions, and this can be somewhat of a bottleneck in improving the models predictive power. We provide a rigorous definition of structural sensitivity and we show how we can quantify the degree of sensitivity of a model based on the Hausdorff distance concept. We propose a simple semi-analytical test of structural sensitivity in an ODE modeling framework. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of directly linking the variability of field/experimental data and model predictions, and we demonstrate a way of assessing the robustness of modeling predictions with respect to data sampling variability. As an insightful illustrative example, we test our sensitivity analysis methods on a chemostat predator–prey model, where we use laboratory data on the feeding of protozoa to parameterize the predator functional response.},

Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In environmental and biological sciences, the predictive uncertainty of process-based models is usually reduced to parametric uncertainty. Here, we propose a practical approach to tackle the added issue of structural sensitivity, the sensitivity of predictions to the choice between quantitatively close and biologically plausible models. In contrast to earlier studies that presented alternative predictions based on alternative models, we propose a probabilistic view of these predictions that include the uncertainty in model construction and the parametric uncertainty of each model. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to a predator–prey system described by the classical Rosenzweig–MacArthur model, and we observe that parametric sensitivity is regularly overcome by structural sensitivity. In addition to tackling theoretical questions about model sensitivity, the proposed approach can also be extended to make probabilistic predictions based on more complex models in an operational context. Both perspectives represent important steps towards providing better model predictions in biology, and beyond.},

	abstract     = {Structured Abstract IntroductionSeveral major developments in theoretical ecology have relied on either dynamical stability or numerical simulations, but oftentimes, they have found contradictory results. This is partly a result of not rigorously checking either the assumption that a steady state is feasible—meaning, all species have constant and positive abundances—or the dependence of results to model parameterization. Here, we extend the concept of structural stability to community ecology in order to account for these two problems. Specifically, we studied the set of conditions leading to the stable coexistence of all species within a community. This shifts the question from asking whether we can find a feasible equilibrium point for a fixed set of parameter values, to asking how large is the range of parameter values that are compatible with the stable coexistence of all species. {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/345/6195/1253497/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{\textgreater}The architecture of plant-animal mutualistic networks modulates the range of conditions leading to the stable coexistence of all species. The area of the different domains represents the structural stability of a model of mutualistic communities with a given network architecture. The nested networks observed in nature—illustrated here by the network at the bottom—lead to a maximum structural stability. RationaleWe begin by disentangling the conditions of global stability from the conditions of feasibility of a steady state in ecological systems. To quantify the domain of stable coexistence, we first find its center (the structural vector of intrinsic growth rates). Next, we determine the boundaries of such a domain by quantifying the amount of variation from the structural vector tolerated before one species goes extinct. Through this two-step approach, we disentangle the effects of the size of the feasibility domain from how close a solution is to its boundary, which is at the heart of previous contradictory results. We illustrate our method by exploring how the observed architecture of mutualistic networks between plants and their pollinators or seed dispersers affects their domain of stable coexistence. ResultsFirst, we determined the network architecture that maximizes the structural stability of mutualistic systems. This corresponds to networks with a maximal level of nestedness, a small trade-off between the number and intensity of interactions a species has, and a high level of mutualistic strength within the constraints of global stability. Second, we found that the large majority of observed mutualistic networks are close to this optimum network architecture, maximizing the range of parameters that are compatible with species coexistence. ConclusionStructural stability has played a major role in several fields such as evolutionary developmental biology, in which it has brought the view that some morphological structures are more common than others because they are compatible with a wider range of developmental conditions. In community ecology, structural stability is the sort of framework needed to study the consequences of global environmental change—by definition, large and directional—on species coexistence. Structural stability will serve to assess both the range of variability a given community can withstand and why some community patterns are more widespread than others. A structural approach to species interactions What determines the stability of ecological networks? Rohr et al. devised a conceptual approach to study interactions between species that emphasizes the role of network structure (see the Perspective by Pawar). Using the example of mutualistic networks of communities of plants and their pollinator species, they show how the structure of networks can determine the persistence of the interactions. Network structures and architectures observed in nature intrinsically match the most stable solution. This approach has promise for application to questions of ecological community stability under global change. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1253497; see also p. 383 In theoretical ecology, traditional studies based on dynamical stability and numerical simulations have not found a unified answer to the effect of network architecture on community persistence. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework based on the concept of structural stability to explain such a disparity of results. We investigated the range of conditions necessary for the stable coexistence of all species in mutualistic systems. We show that the apparently contradictory conclusions reached by previous studies arise as a consequence of overseeing either the necessary conditions for persistence or its dependence on model parameterization. We show that observed network architectures maximize the range of conditions for species coexistence. We discuss the applicability of structural stability to study other types of interspecific interactions. In ecology, structural stability influences the range of perturbations mutualistic networks can withstand. [Also see Perspective by Pawar] In ecology, structural stability influences the range of perturbations mutualistic networks can withstand. [Also see Perspective by Pawar]},

	abstract     = {A quantitative approach to species coexistence based on the invasibility criterion has led to an appreciation of coexistence mechanisms in terms of stabilizing and equalizing components, but major challenges are the need to consider general multispecies settings, interactions beyond competition, and multiple scales of space and time. Moreover, two essential concepts, species-level average fitness and scaling factors, have not had clear definitions. A general approach to defining average fitnesses and scaling factors is given, along with the origin of stabilizing mechanisms as deviations from a reference model where no coexistence is possible. Illustrations are general Lotka–Volterra models, models accounting specifically for resource use and natural enemies, and models with temporal fluctuations. Community averages of stabilizing mechanisms reveal overall opportunities for coexistence, and define mechanisms more precisely through their formulae. Average fitnesses adjusted for the presence of coexistence mechanisms provide a better definition of equalizing mechanisms. While these ideas apply to the components of invasion rates, permanence theory and stochastic persistence theory show how invasion rates can be used to demonstrate species coexistence in complex settings. Although species coexistence has often focused on competition, detailed models of the roles of natural enemies provide a new perspective on the opportunities for coexistence in nature. The concept of apparent competition recognizes the essential symmetry between density-dependence from resource depletion and from supporting natural enemies. Natural enemy partitioning is the natural analogue of resource partitioning and has an equivalent role in promoting coexistence. Rather than reinforcing each other, however, the strength of coexistence is often intermediate between that implied by resource partitioning alone and that implied by natural enemy partitioning alone, as elucidated by recent Lotka–Volterra theory. Synthesis. Although there are alternative approaches for understanding coexistence in multispecies settings, ideas based on stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms continue to provide new insights. Multiple species and multiple trophic levels are naturally challenging, but the new theories of permanence and stochastic persistence support the critical role of invasion rates in species coexistence, and thus support the understanding to be derived by partitioning invasion rates into average fitness differences and stabilizing components.},

However, much of the evidence comes from artificial experimental arenas under conditions not necessarily representative of the natural system, and neglecting the temporal dynamics of the organism (in particular the effects of prey depletion on the estimated functional response). Here we present a method that removes these limitations by reconstructing the functional response non-parametrically from predator-prey time-series data. This method is applied to data on a protozoan predator-prey interaction, and we obtain significant evidence of predator dependence in the functional response. A crucial element in this analysis is to include time-lags in the prey and predator reproduction rates, and we show that these delays improve the fit of the model significantly. Finally, we compare the non-parametrically reconstructed functional response to parametric forms, and suggest that a modified version of the Hassell V arley predator interference model provides a simple and flexible function for theoretical investigation and applied modelling.},

The emergence of theories of self-organisation required progress in several areas including chemistry, physics, computing and cybernetics. Two parallel lines of development can be distinguished which both culminated in the early 1970s. Firstly, physicochemical theories of self-organisation arose from theoretical (Lotka 1910–1920) and experimental work (Bray 1920; Belousov 1951) on chemical oscillations. However, this research area gained broader acceptance only after thermodynamics was extended to systems far from equilibrium (1922–1967) and the mechanism of the prime example for a chemical oscillator, the Belousov–Zhabotinski reaction, was deciphered in the early 1970s. Secondly, biological theories of self-organisation were rooted in the intellectual environment of artificial intelligence and cybernetics. Turing wrote his The chemical basis of morphogenesis (1952) after working on the construction of one of the first electronic computers. Likewise, Gierer and Meinhardt’s theory of local activation and lateral inhibition (1972) was influenced by ideas from cybernetics. The Gierer–Meinhardt theory provided an explanation for the first time of both spontaneous formation of spatial order and of self-regulation that proved to be extremely successful in elucidating a wide range of patterning processes. With the advent of developmental genetics in the 1980s, detailed molecular and functional data became available for complex developmental processes, allowing a new generation of data-driven theoretical approaches. Three examples of such approaches will be discussed. The successes and limitations of mathematical pattern formation theory throughout its history suggest a picture of the organism, which has structural similarity to views of the organic world held by the philosopher Immanuel Kant at the end of the eighteenth century.},

Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as ‘predictive’, in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

	abstract     = {Ecology, though poor in philosophical scrutiny, is full of foundational controversies. The holism-reductionism debate is one associated with ontological, methodological and epistemological premises. During the beginning of the twentieth century, ecology appeared highly holistic mainly due to Frederic Clements's organismic approach. Influential criticism gathered, however, and by the middle of the century ecology seemed divided in two conflicting camps, reductionists and holists. Yet for the majority of ecologists eclecticism was the only choice since both doctrines were a poor description of the reality they faced in the field. Thus, by the beginning of the 1980s, ecologists searched for more pluralistic approaches which seemed more adequate to deal with nature's complexity. Evolutionary geneticist and ecologist Richard Levins was one such pioneer against closed systems of thought, such as holism and reductionism, proposing instead a dialectical approach. His view served both as a salve to the fallacies committed by vulgar reductionism and as a response to the rise of systems ecology. We consider Levins's arguments as a breakthrough to a challenging heuristic, a constant reminder of the limitations faced by scientists and an homage to self-consciousness},

This “resource‐ratio theory” has been used to make a number of testable predictions about competition and community patterns. We reviewed 1,333 papers that cite Tilman’s two publications to determine whether predictions of the resource‐ratio theory have been adequately tested and to summarize their general conclusions. Most of the citations do not directly test the theory: only 26 studies provide well‐designed tests of one or more predictions, resulting in 42 individual tests of predictions. Most of these tests were conducted in the laboratory or experimental microcosms and used primary producers in freshwater systems. Overall, the predictions of the resource‐ratio theory were supported 75\% of the time. One of the primary predictions of the model, that species dominance varies with the ratio of resource availabilities, was supported by 13 of 16 tests, but most other predictions have been insufficiently tested. We suggest that more experimental work in a variety of natural systems is seriously needed, especially studies designed to test predictions related to resource supply and consumption rates.},

	abstract     = {Competition is an important interaction in ecology, and many experiments have been done to examine the effects of intraspeciﬁc and interspeciﬁc competition. Unfortunately, most of these experiments have been done using either substitution or additive experimental designs. Substitution designs, and to a lesser extent additive designs, severely limit the useful inferences that ecologists can draw from the resulting data. Response surface experimental designs, which vary the densities of two competing species independently, offer the advantage of being able to compare the ﬁts of alternative competition models and to estimate model parameters. This kind of experimental design has been relatively little used in ecology to date. I consider the use of response surface designs from two perspectives. The ﬁrst is the optimal allocation of experimental effort among density treatments, with the goal of distinguishing among alternative models. Second, I compare the ability of six response surface designs to estimate known competition coefﬁcients correctly, using simulated data. Low densities and densities near equilibrium in one generation tend to return similar densities the following generation and thus provide little or no information for comparing alternative population models. Experimental designs that span a wide range of densities, including high densities above carrying capacities, provide more accurate parameter estimates in general, but low densities are helpful for estimating population growth rates. Designs that are not fully factorial are one compromise solution that can yield accurate parameter estimates for models and yet require less experimental effort than full factorial surfaces. In general, response surfaces are a powerful class of experimental design and offer potentially stronger connections between empirical and theoretical approaches than traditional experimental designs.},

To reconcile these contrasting observations, we postulate the existence of a backbone of interactions underlying all ecological networks—a common substructure within every network comprised of species playing similar ecological roles—and a periphery of species whose idiosyncrasies help explain the differences between networks. To test this conjecture, we introduce a new approach to investigate the structural similarity of 411 food webs from multiple environments and biomes. We first find significant differences in the way species in different ecosystems interact with each other. Despite these differences, we then show that there is compelling evidence of a common backbone of interactions underpinning all food webs. We expect that identifying a backbone of interactions will shed light on the rules driving assembly of different ecological communities.}

	abstract     = {We examine the relationship between Digitalis purpurea and its pollinators, bumblebees, and construct a model for the foraging behavior of the bees based on the theory for energy maximization in a "patchy" environment. The nectar reward in the vertical inflorescences of Digitalis shows a consistent pattern; the caloric value of the reward is greatest in the lowest, oldest flowers and decreases as one moves up the inflorescence. The model predicts whether or not bees should forage in a given inflorescence, how they should forage on an acceptable inflorescence, and when they should leave a plant. The behavior of bumblebees foraging on these inflorescences is consistent with the model. Bees begin foraging at the lowermost flowers (those with the greatest reward), continue up the inflorescence, avoid revisiting flowers, and depart when the energy return expected from the next higher flower is lower than the average return expected from a new plant. Bumblebees skip flowers as they move up inflorescences with a spiral flower arrangement, thereby lowering their rate of energy intake. We suggest this behavior serves to prevent the more costly mistake of revisiting flowers. Digitalis is protandrous; the lowermost flowers are predominantly female, and flowers 3 to 7 are male. The pattern of nectar rewards exhibited by this species encourages bees 1) to visit the female flowers first, fertilizing them with pollen from another plant, and 2) to remain on the plant long enough to remove pollen from at least one male flower, thus benefiting the plants by promoting outcrossing and increasing probabilities of pollen transfer These findings suggest that natural selection has favored careful regulation of the amount of reward in individual Digitalis flowers.},

	abstract     = {Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies. Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers. We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10 ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena. We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L. corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T. repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L. corniculatus on their first visit. Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract     = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast cholinergic synaptic transmission and play roles in many cognitive processes. They are under intense research as potential targets of drugs used to treat neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Invertebrate nAChRs are targets of anthelmintics as well as a major group of insecticides, the neonicotinoids. The honey bee, Apis mellifera, is one of the most beneficial insects worldwide, playing an important role in crop pollination, and is also a valuable model system for studies on social interaction, sensory processing, learning, and memory. We have used the A. mellifera genome information to characterize the complete honey bee nAChR gene family. Comparison with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae shows that the honey bee possesses the largest family of insect nAChR subunits to date (11 members). As with Drosophila and Anopheles, alternative splicing of conserved exons increases receptor diversity. Also, we show that in one honey bee nAChR subunit, six adenosine residues are targeted for RNA A-to-I editing, two of which are evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila melanogaster and Heliothis virescens orthologs, and that the extent of editing increases as the honey bee lifecycle progresses, serving to maximize receptor diversity at the adult stage. These findings on Apis mellifera enhance our understanding of nAChR functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the development of improved insecticides that spare a major beneficial insect species.},

	abstract     = {Mutualisms provide benefits to interacting species, but they also involve costs. If costs come to exceed benefits as population density or the frequency of encounters between species increases, the interaction will no longer be mutualistic. Thus curves that represent benefits and costs as functions of interaction frequency are important tools for predicting when a mutualism will tip over into antagonism. Currently, most of what we know about benefit and cost curves in pollination mutualisms comes from highly specialized pollinating seed–consumer mutualisms, such as the yucca moth–yucca interaction. There, benefits to female reproduction saturate as the number of visits to a flower increases (because the amount of pollen needed to fertilize all the flower's ovules is finite), but costs continue to increase (because pollinator offspring consume developing seeds), leading to a peak in seed production at an intermediate number of visits. But for most plant–pollinator mutualisms, costs to the plant are more subtle than consumption of seeds, and how such costs scale with interaction frequency remains largely unknown. Here, we present reasonable benefit and cost curves that are appropriate for typical pollinator–plant interactions, and we show how they can result in a wide diversity of relationships between net benefit (benefit minus cost) and interaction frequency. We then use maximum-likelihood methods to fit net-benefit curves to measures of female reproductive success for three typical pollination mutualisms from two continents, and for each system we chose the most parsimonious model using information-criterion statistics. We discuss the implications of the shape of the net-benefit curve for the ecology and evolution of plant–pollinator mutualisms, as well as the challenges that lie ahead for disentangling the underlying benefit and cost curves for typical pollination mutualisms.},

	abstract     = {In multi-armed bandit situations, gamblers must choose repeatedly between options that differ in reward probability, without prior information on the options' relative profitability. Foraging bumblebees encounter similar situations when choosing repeatedly among flower species that differ in food rewards. Unlike proficient gamblers, bumblebees do not choose the highest-rewarding option exclusively. This incomplete exclusiveness may reflect an adaptive sampling strategy. A cost—benefit analysis predicts decreased sampling levels with increasing differences in mean profitability between the available food sources. We simulated two-armed bandit situations in laboratory experiments to test this prediction. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris L.) made 300 foraging visits to blue and yellow artificial flowers that dispensed sucrose solution according to seven probabilistic reward schedules. Reward schedules varied in profitability differences between the two feeding options. As predicted, the bees specialized more on the higher-rewarding food type (and thus sampled the alternative less) when the mean reward difference between the feeding options was larger. Choice ratios of individual bees were linearly related to the reward ratios they had experienced. It has been suggested that the behavioral mechanism underlying incomplete exclusiveness may involve simple rules of thumb that do not require long-term memory. However, the bees' response to recent foraging experience (rewarded and non-rewarded visits) differed between the beginning and the end of observation sessions and between treatments. Simulations of the Rescorla-Wagner difference learning rule reproduced the main trends of the results. These findings suggest that the observed incomplete exclusiveness results from associative learning involving long-term memory.}

Each bumblebee species concentrated its foraging efforts on a different flower species, apparently choosing the species whose corolla tube length matched its proboscis length most closely. When each bumblebee species was temporarily removed from its preferred flower species, the remaining bumblebee species increased visitation to the other, previously less—utilized, flower species. The remaining bumblebees visited more flowers per stay in the patch, suggesting that they were finding greater amounts of nectar in the absence of other bumblebee species. These removal experiments demonstrated that the bumblebees were sampling flowers frequently enough and were flexible enough in their foraging behavior to respond rapidly to short—term changes in nectar availability. In another area, where its preferred flower species and the other bumblebee species were absent, B. flavifrons foraged actively on the flower species it rarely used in Gothic. This observation and the experiments demonstrate that resource utilization by a bumblebee species is influenced by the presence of other species and suggest that the phenomenon of competitive release can be observed in bumblebees. In this system,interspecific exploitation competition appears to be the primary mechanism involved in resource partitioning.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

When gathering nectar from two of the three species, bumblebees encountering a series of enriched plants initially increased the number of flowers per inflorescence that they visited relative to control inflorescences. After the blossoms from a small number of enriched racemes were probed, the average number of flowers visited per plant returned to control levels. These results are consistent with the predictions made by Ollason and suggest that foragers' assessment of habitat quality is modified during a foraging bout. These results are used to estimate the extent of bumblebees' memories of previously encountered nectar rewards. The small estimated size of bumblebee memories may be adaptive under spatially heterogeneous reward schedules.},

	abstract     = {The majority of species of flowering plants rely on pollination by insects, so that their reproductive success and in part their population structure are determined by insect behaviour. The foraging behaviour of insect pollinators is flexible and complex, because efficient collection of nectar or pollen is no simple matter. Each flower provides a variable but generally small reward that is often hidden, flowers are patchily distributed in time and space, and are erratically depleted of rewards by other foragers. Insects that specialise in visiting flowers have evolved an array of foraging strategies that act to improve their efficiency, which in turn determine the reproductive success of the plants that they visit. This review attempts a synthesis of the recent literature on selectivity in pollinator foraging behaviour, in terms of the species, patch and individual flowers that they choose to visit. The variable nature of floral resources necessitate foraging behaviour based upon flexible learning, so that foragers can respond to the pattern of rewards that they encounter. Fidelity to particular species allows foragers to learn appropriate handling skills and so reduce handling times, but may also be favoured by use of a search image to detect flowers. The rewards received are also used to determine the spatial patterns of searches; distance and direction of flights are adjusted so that foragers tend to remain within rewarding patches and depart swiftly from unrewarding ones. The distribution of foragers among patchy resources generally conforms to the expectations of two simple optimal foraging models, the ideal free distribution and the marginal value theorem. Insects are able to learn to discriminate among flowers of their preferred species on the basis of subtle differences in floral morphology. They may discriminate upon the basis of flower size, age, sex or symmetry and so choose the more rewarding flowers. Some insects are also able to distinguish and reject depleted flowers on the basis of ephemeral odours left by previous visitors. These odours have recently been implicated as a mechanism involved in interspecific interactions between foragers. From the point of view of a plant reliant upon insect pollination, the behaviour of its pollinators (and hence its reproductive success) is likely to vary according to the rewards offered, the size and complexity of floral displays used to advertise their location, the distribution of conspecific and of rewards offered by other plant species, and the abundance and behaviour of other flower visitors.},

Conversely, both honey bees and bumblebees,Bombusspp., can mark rewarding flowers with scent marks that promote probing by conspecifics. We examined detection of recently visited flowers in a mixed community of bumblebees foraging on comfrey,Symphytum officinale, in southern England. When foraging among inflorescences on a plant, three abundant species ofBombusprobed fewer inflorescences more than once than would be expected from random foraging. Bees frequently encountered inflorescences but departed without probing them for nectar. Examination of the incidence of such rejections in the two most common species,B.terrestrisandB.pascuorum, revealed that the low incidence of multiple probing visits was due to two factors: bees both foraged systematically and selectively rejected inflorescences that they had previously visited. When presented with inflorescences of known history, bees selectively rejected those that had been recently visited by themselves or by conspecifics compared with randomly selected inflorescences. They were also able to distinguish inflorescences that had been visited by otherBombusspecies. Bees were unable to distinguish and reject inflorescences from which the nectar had been removed artificially. We conclude that theseBombusspecies are probably using scent marks left by previous visitors. The significance of deposition and detection of interspecific scent marks for competitive interactions between species is discussed.},

	abstract     = {It is widely believed that mutualisms, interspecific interactions that benefit both species, have been grossly neglected relative to their true importance in nature. I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quentitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22\% of theover 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90\% of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52\%) and seed dispersal (31\%), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63\%) focused simply on identifying the mutualist of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or comibinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.},

Their results were inconclusive suggesting, they said, that bees do not continuously compete for floral resources. We questioned their use of the number of open flowers as a measure of resource availability to bees because it is the nectar contained within those flowers that is the resource actually utilized. In two Rocky Mountain meadows we attempted to correlate bumblebee abundance with both the number of available flowers and the number of flowers multiplied by their 24 hour nectar production rates. Our results demonstrated that merely using floral abundance as an estimate of resource availability can be very misleading. The more time consuming method of quantifying the resources actually used by bees should be performed if meaningful conclusions concerning competition are to be drawn.}

Several studies show a strong influence of either resource limitation, pollen limitation or a combined effect of both. The theoretical arguments for resource limitation are abundant, but there has been very little work done concerning the effect of pollinator availability. In this paper we construct a model to study how the reproductive success in plants is influenced by the foraging behaviour of the pollinators. The pollinator population is assumed to have a constant population density. A functional response function for the pollinators is derived. It is similar to a Holling type II functional response. It is shown that, since the pollinators are regulated by factors not included in the model and their capability to pollinate is limited by the functional response, this is sufficient for regulating the plant population. There also exists a threshold condition for the persistence of the plant population that depended on the search rate of the pollinators and the demographic parameters of the plant population. If this threshold condition is not satisfied the plant population cannot persist and will become extinct. If the condition is satisfied the plant population grows until it is limited at the equilibrium mentioned above.},

Although the concepts and measurement of interaction strength in food webs have received much attention, there has been comparatively little progress in the context of mutualism. We propose a conceptual scheme for studying the strength of plant–animal mutualistic interactions. We first review the interaction strength concepts developed for food webs, and explore how these concepts have been applied to mutualistic interactions. We then outline and explain a conceptual framework for defining ecological effects in plant–animal mutualisms. We give recommendations for measuring interaction strength from data collected in field studies based on a proposed approach for the assessment of interaction strength in plant–animal mutualisms. This approach is conceptually integrative and methodologically feasible, as it focuses on two key variables usually measured in field studies: the frequency of interactions and the fitness components influenced by the interactions.},

Analogously, prey-, predator-, and ratio-dependent functional responses are apparently alternative functional responses for other types of consumer–resource interactions. These include, for example, the fraction of flowers pollinated or seeds parasitized in pollination (pre-dispersal) seed-parasitism mutualisms, such as those between fig wasps and fig trees or yucca moths and yucca plants. Here we examine the appropriate functional responses for how the fraction of flowers pollinated and seeds parasitized vary with the density of pollinators (predator dependence) or the ratio of pollinator and flower densities (ratio dependence). We show that both types of functional responses can emerge from minor, but biologically important variations on a single model. An individual-based model was first used to describe plant–pollinator interactions. Conditional upon on whether the number of flowers visited by the pollinator was limited by factors other than search time (e.g., by the number of eggs it had to lay, if it was also a seed parasite), and on whether the pollinator could directly find flowers on a plant, or had to search, the simulation results lead to either a predator-dependent or a ratio-dependent functional response. An analytic model was then used to show mathematically how these two cases can arise.},

	abstract     = {Mutualistic interactions almost always produce both costs and benefits for each of the interacting species. It is the difference between gross benefits and costs that determines the net benefit and the per-capita effect on each of the interacting populations. For example, the net benefit of obligate pollinators, such as yucca and senita moths, to plants is determined by the difference between the number of ovules fertilized from moth pollination and the number of ovules eaten by the pollinator's larvae. It is clear that if pollinator populations are large, then, because many eggs are laid, costs to plants are large, whereas, if pollinator populations are small, gross benefits are low due to lack of pollination. Even though the size and dynamics of the pollinator population are likely to be crucial, their importance has been neglected in the investigation of mechanisms, such as selective fruit abortion, that can limit costs and increase net benefits. Here, we suggest that both the population size and dynamics of pollinators are important in determining the net benefits to plants, and that fruit abortion can significantly affect these. We develop a model of mutualism between populations of plants and their pollinating seed-predators to explore the ecological consequences of fruit abortion on pollinator population dynamics and the net effect on plants. We demonstrate that the benefit to a plant population is unimodal as a function of pollinator abundance, relative to the abundance of flowers. Both selective abortion of fruit with eggs and random abortion of fruit, without reference to whether they have eggs or not, can limit pollinator population size. This can increase the net benefits to the plant population by limiting the number of eggs laid, if the pollination rate remains high. However, fruit abortion can possibly destabilize the pollinator population, with negative consequences for the plant population.},

Here, we develop general theory for the density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism based on the C–R mechanism of interspecific interaction. To test the influence of C–R interactions on the dynamics and stability of bi- and uni-directional C–R mutualisms, we developed simple models that link consumer functional response of one mutualistic species with the resources supplied by another. Phase-plane analyses show that the ecological dynamics of C–R mutualisms are stable in general. Most transient behavior leads to an equilibrium of mutualistic coexistence, at which both species densities are greater than in the absence of interactions. However, due to the basic nature of C–R interactions, certain density-dependent conditions can lead to C–R dynamics characteristic of predator–prey interactions, in which one species overexploits and causes the other to go extinct. Consistent with empirical phenomena, these results suggest that the C–R interaction can provide a broad mechanism for understanding density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism. By unifying predation, competition, and mutualism under the common ecological framework of consumer–resource theory, we may also gain a better understanding of the universal features of interspecific interactions in general.},

The objective was to elucidate interspecific patterns in the “quantity” component of the plant-pollinator interaction. A total of 54 insect taxa are considered in the analyses, including hynenopterans, dipterans and lepidopterans. Most pollinators were comparatively scarce, with a few taxa acounting collectively for the majority of individuals. Pollinators differed broadly in flower visitation rate (0.2–30 flowers/min). Most of this variation was explained by differences in flower handling time (HT). Regardless of proboscis length, hymenopterans had intrinsically shorter handling times than lepidopterans. Within each group, HT decreased exponentially with increasing proboscis length. Abundance and visitation rate were uncorrelated across pollinator taxa. The total number of visits that each pollinator contributed to the plant (NFV) was estimated as the product of abundance x visitation rate. NFV values spanned four orders of magnirade. A small, taxonomically diverse group of species (1 moth, 1 butterfly, 4 bees) accounted for most visits and thus could effectively exert some selection on floral features. Nevertheless, the morphological diversity represented in this group of dominant pollinators probably constrains plant specialization, as they will most likely select for different floral features or in opposing directions on the same traits.},

In the present paper, we report the results of experiments undertaken to evaluate this hypothesis. A single °1—ha site was studied. Visitation rates by Apis and native bees were determined, as were rates of nectar secretion and amounts of nectar available to the bees. Nectar available to bees was increased by excluding ants, which foraged on the stalks both during the day and at night. A. schottii flowers secrete 90\% of their nectar at night. Prior to this exclusion, ants consumed °85\% of the nightly accumulation. At first, the ants were excluded from only 10 flower stalks out of °130. These stalks were visited by greater numbers of both honey bees and bumble bees than were the controls. The experimental stalks also had higher standing crops of available nectar. Next, ants were excluded from all of the stalks on and surrounding the study site by treating them with Tree Tanglefoot. Following this manipulation the number of honey bees again increased, but the numbers of Bombus remained at the level of the controls of the first experiment. A significant increase in the numbers of small solitary bees on the stalks was also observed. These species generally foraged later in the day than Apis and Bombus, which were both active primarily early in the morning and before dusk. During these manipulations, two hives of Cordovan honey bees, a light—colored strain of Apis mellifera, were present on the site. The subsequent introduction of two additional hives had no discernible effect on the number of honey bees visiting the flowers. The final experiment consisted of removing the Cordovan hives. Thereafter the number of darker feral honey bees observed on the flowers increased until it approached the previous combined total of Cordovans (°75\% of the total) and ferals. Concomitantly, the numbers of Bombus and small solitary bees first increased and then declined.},

The main advantages of such a “functional response” are its simplicity, general applicability, and well understood mechanistic basis. In systems where predators compete directly for the available prey however, the functional response should depend not only on the prey density but also on the predator density. We aim here to devise a simple and generic “predator-dependent” functional response. We derive such a functional response by making quasi-steady-state assumptions for models, in which we allow predators and prey to form interaction complexes. We end up with the—previously proposed—“Beddington” functional response. Because of our formal derivation this simple predator-dependent functional response is now based on clear mechanistic reasoning. The direct predator interference of this functional response emerges from the interaction between a predator and a prey, and not from direct predator-predator interactions. We conclude however, that, although the Beddington functional response is generic for a two-dimensional system of one prey interacting with one predator, it is difficult to generalize it to higher dimensional systems consisting of several prey and predator species.},

	abstract     = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1546–1559 Abstract Species coexistence within ecosystems and the stability of patterns of temporal changes in population sizes are central topics in ecological theory. In the last decade, adaptive behaviour has been proposed as a mechanism of population stabilization. In particular, widely distributed adaptive trophic behaviour (ATB), the fitness-enhancing changes in individuals’ feeding-related traits due to variation in their trophic environment, may play a key role in modulating the dynamics of feeding relationships within natural communities. In this article, we review and synthesize models and results from theoretical research dealing with the consequences of ATB on the structure and dynamics of complex food webs. We discuss current approaches, point out limitations, and consider questions ripe for future research. In spite of some differences in the modelling and analytic approaches, there are points of convergence: (1) ATB promotes the complex structure of ecological networks, (2) ATB increases the stability of their dynamics, (3) ATB reverses May’s negative complexity–stability relationship, and (4) ATB provides resilience and resistance of networks against perturbations. Current knowledge supports ATB as an essential ingredient for models of community dynamics, and future research that incorporates ATB will be well positioned to address questions important for basic ecological research and its applications.},

	abstract     = {Competition and predation are the most heavily investigated species interactions in ecology, dominating studies of species diversity maintenance. However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does1, although theoretical models have long supported diverse views1,2,3,4,5. Here we show, using a comprehensive three-trophic-level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within-species density feedback loops to be stronger than between-species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions.},

	abstract     = {Holling's (1959) disc equation is the most commonly used model of type—2 functional response. The constant—parameter version of this model makes three assumptions that are seldom likely to be satisfied: (i) attack rate per unit search time per unit prey density is independent of prey density; (ii) handling time is independent of prey density; and (iii) the relative rates of successful and unsuccessful attack are independent of prey density. Optimal foraging theory is used to suggest how each of these components of the predation process might depend on prey density. Explorations of simple models suggest that these types of adaptive variation are often consistent with type—2 responses, but generally result in shapes that differ significantly from the disc equation. The consequence of using a constant—parameter disc equation model when it is inappropriate is limited ability to predict functional responses in altered circumstances, for example, in the presence of a second prey. The potential ability to understand multispecies systems from their subcomponents cannot be assessed unless appropriate models of the functional response are used to describe the component systems; these models are likely to include adaptive behavior.},

These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceeds in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., phenology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure has important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

	abstract     = {Intransitive competition is often projected to be a widespread mechanism of species coexistence in ecological communities. However, it is unknown how much of the coexistence we observe in nature results from this mechanism when species interactions are also stabilized by pairwise niche differences. We combined field-parameterized models of competition among 18 annual plant species with tools from network theory to quantify the prevalence of intransitive competitive relationships. We then analyzed the predicted outcome of competitive interactions with and without pairwise niche differences. Intransitive competition was found for just 15–19\% of the 816 possible triplets, and this mechanism was never sufficient to stabilize the coexistence of the triplet when the pair-wise niche differences between competitors were removed. Of the transitive and intransitive triplets, only four were predicted to coexist and these were more similar in multidimensional trait space defined by 11 functional traits than non-coexisting triplets. Our results argue that intransitive competition may be less frequent than recently posed, and that even when it does operate, pairwise niche differences may be key to possible coexistence.},

Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT's mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT's spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-defined mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under fluctuating temperature, plant–soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.},

	abstract     = {Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors’ intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.},

Drawing on the theory of consumer-resource interactions, as well as its graphical analysis, they develop a framework for understanding niches that is flexible enough to include a variety of small- and large-scale processes, from resource competition, predation, and stress to community structure, biodiversity, and ecosystem function.

For example, the accumulation of nutrients, provision of shade, amelioration of disturbance, or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity2. But there have been no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer sites.},

Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context dependency across these context types was not consistent among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean outcomes, can provide a general method for describing patterns of variation in nature.},

Nevertheless, the incidence of fire within a fire-prone region may present strong variations at the local, landscape scale. This study tests the prediction that woody communities on acid, nutrient-poor soils should exhibit more pronounced phenotypic and phylogenetic clustering patterns than woody communities on fertile soils, as a consequence of their higher flammability and, hence, presumably higher propensity to recurrent fire. Results confirm the predictions and show that habitat filtering driven by fire may be detected even in local communities from an already fire-filtered regional flora.

	abstract     = {1. In relatively fertile ecosystems, such as the tallgrass prairie, local species diversity is largely controlled by the competitive effects of community dominants. Despite the relative importance of soil resources in shaping competitive outcomes, we have a limited understanding of the ways by which plants partition below-ground space and resources while competing, and thus, how these interactions feedback to affect local diversity. 2. We experimentally tested whether potential rooting depth affected plant species diversity and composition by seeding 36 tallgrass prairie species into replicated, bare-ground plots in which soil depth was manipulated to produce shallow- (20 cm), medium- (42 cm) and deep-soil treatments all within one soil type. Because root architecture and foraging strategies differ among species, we hypothesized that soil depth alone could affect plant richness, diversity and community composition. 3. After 3 years, richness (S) significantly increased with soil depth (P {\textless} 0.0001), but there was no significant change in species diversity (P {\textgreater} 0.1) or composition (multi-response permutation procedure, P {\textgreater} 0.2). The lack of a depth effect upon diversity resulted from the opposing effect of increasing soil depth enhancing S, but decreasing evenness. 4. Species presence among depth treatments was strongly nested, with species found in shallow soils reflecting a subset of the species found in the medium-depth treatment, and the species found within the medium-depth treatment reflecting a subset of those found in the deepest soils. 5. All depth treatments contained the same dominant grasses, thus differences in S resulted from the nested loss of forbs. Conversely, increasing soil depth added sets of new species, but the specific identity of the species present appeared interchangeable among replicates of a given depth. 6. Synthesis. Our results provide the first field-based experimental evidence that altering soil depth alters species occurrence and diversity in predictable ways in seeded tallgrass prairie. Our results have important theoretical implications for understanding the processes promoting plant co-occurrence in grasslands, and generate testable hypotheses concerning the conditions under which root-niche partitioning is probably important for maintaining local richness in grasslands. Future work is needed to elucidate the generality and mechanistic basis of our results.},

However, earlier studies have concluded that the speciﬁc mechanisms of plant-pollinator interactions are destabilizing and should lead to a loss of diversity. Here we present a mechanistic model of plant and pollinator population dynamics with the ability to represent a broad spectrum of interaction structures. Using this model, we examined the inﬂuence of pollinators on the stability of a plant community and the relationship between pollinator specialization and stability. In accordance with earlier work, our results show that plant-pollinator interactions may severely destabilize plant coexistence, regardless of the degree of pollinator specialization. However, if plant niche differentiation, a classical stabilizing mechanism, is sufﬁciently strong to overcome the minority disadvantage with respect to pollination, interactions with pollinators may even increase the stability of a plant community. In addition to plant niche differentiation, the relationship between specialization and stability depends on a number of parameters that affect pollinator growth rates. Our results highlight the complex effects of this particular type of mutualism on community stability and call for further investigations of the mechanisms of diversity maintenance in plant-pollinator systems.},

We show, by way of theoretical analyses with empirically informed parameters, that structural properties can alter the stability of mutualistic communities characterized by nonlinear functional responses among the interacting species. Speciﬁcally, community resilience is enhanced by increasing community size (species diversity) and the number of species interactions (connectivity), and through strong, symmetric interaction strengths of highly nested networks. As a result, mutualistic communities show largely positive complexity–stability relationships, in opposition to the standard paradox. Thus, contrary to the commonlyheld belief that mutualismÕs positive feedback destabilizes food webs, our results suggest that interplay between the structure and function of ecological networks in general, and consideration of mutualistic interactions in particular, may be key to understanding complexity–stability relationships of biological communities as a whole.},

Decreasing functional responses are associated with situations in which there are costs to resource consumption. If the process of resource acquisition has costs, decreasing functional responses may occur when there is a single homogeneous resource. If the cost is solely a function of the amount of resource ingested, decreasing functional responses on a single resource do not occur. Both types of cost can produce decreasing functional responses when there are two resource types and a trade-off relationship between consumption of one and consumption of the other. Decreasing functional responses seem to be most likely to occur on a food that yields high benefits and costs per unit of foraging time or effort when there is an alternative resource which yields low benefits and costs. Given this type of foraging choice, the functional response is most likely to decrease when the benefits of ingestion increase at a decreasing rate, and the costs of ingestion increase at an increasing rate with amount ingested. An important and unique consequence of decreasing functional responses is the possibility of population cycles in differential equation models of consumer-resource systems with non-reproducing resources; this is illustrated with a simple const/mer-resource model.},

	abstract     = {A large part of biodiversity theory is driven by the basic question of what allows species to coexist in spite of a confined number of niches. A substantial theoretical background to this question is provided by modern coexistence theory (MCT), which rests on mathematical approaches of invasion analysis to categorize underlying mechanisms into factors that reduce either niche overlap (stabilizing mechanisms) or the average fitness differences of species (equalizing mechanisms). While MCT has inspired biodiversity theory in the search for these underlying mechanisms, we feel that the strong focus on coexistence causes a bias toward the most abundant species and neglects the plethora of species that are less abundant and often show high local turnover. Given the more stochastic nature of their occurrence, we advocate a complementary cross-level approach that links individuals, small populations, and communities and explicitly takes into account (1) a more complete inclusion of environmental and demographic stochasticity affecting small populations, (2) intraspecific trait variation and behavioral plasticity, and (3) local heterogeneities, interactions, and feedbacks. Focusing on mechanisms that drive the temporary coviability of species rather than infinite coexistence, we suggest a new approach that could be dubbed coviability analysis (CVA). From a modeling perspective, CVA builds on the merged approaches of individual-based modeling and population viability analysis but extends them to the community level. From an empirical viewpoint, CVA calls for a stronger integration of spatiotemporal data on variability and noise, changing drivers, and interactions at the level of individuals. The resulting large volumes of data from multiple sources could be strongly supported by novel techniques tailored to the discovery of complex patterns in high-dimensional data. By complementing MCT through a stronger focus on the coviability of less common species, this approach can help make modern biodiversity theory more comprehensive, predictive, and relevant for applications.},

The overlooked property is that stabilizing mechanisms (increasing species’ niche differences) and equalizing mechanisms (reducing species’ fitness differences) have two distinct sets of meanings within MCT: one in a two-species context and another in a general multispecies context. We demonstrate that the two-species framework is not a special case of the multispecies one, and therefore these two parallel frameworks must be studied independently. Our first result is that, using the two-species framework and mechanistic consumer-resource models, stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms exhibit complex interdependence, such that changing one will simultaneously change the other. Furthermore, the nature and direction of this simultaneous change sensitively depend on model parameters. The second result states that while MCT is often seen as bridging niche and neutral modes of coexistence by building a niche-neutrality continuum, the interdependence between stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms acts to break this continuum under almost any biologically relevant circumstance. We conclude that the complex entanglement of stabilizing and equalizing terms makes their impact on coexistence difficult to understand, but by seeing them as aggregated effects (rather than underlying causes) of coexistence, we may increase our understanding of ecological dynamics.},

	abstract     = {Increasing evidence for rapid evolution suggests that the maintenance of species diversity in ecological communities may be influenced by more than purely ecological processes. Classic theory shows that interspecific competition may select for traits that increase niche differentiation, weakening competition and thus promoting species coexistence. While empirical work has demonstrated trait evolution in response to competition, if and how evolution affects the dynamics of the competing species—the key step for completing the required eco-evolutionary feedback—has been difficult to resolve. Here, we show that evolution in response to interspecific competition feeds back to change the course of competitive population dynamics of aquatic plant species over 10–15 generations in the field. By manipulating selection imposed by heterospecific competitors in experimental ponds, we demonstrate that (i) interspecific competition drives rapid genotypic change, and (ii) this evolutionary change in one competitor, while not changing the coexistence outcome, causes the population trajectories of the two competing species to converge. In contrast to the common expectation that interspecific competition should drive the evolution of niche differentiation, our results suggest that genotypic evolution resulted in phenotypic changes that altered population dynamics by affecting the competitive hierarchy. This result is consistent with theory suggesting that competition for essential resources can limit opportunities for the evolution of niche differentiation. Our finding that rapid evolution regulates the dynamics of competing species suggests that ecosystems may rely on continuous feedbacks between ecology and evolution to maintain species diversity.},

		With nature “red in tooth and claw” (1), how do so many species coexist? Why do some species not outcompete the others to extinction? This is a question that has long fascinated ecologists and evolutionary biologists (2), especially given the incredible diversity of seemingly similar species in tropical forests or on coral reefs around the world. Most explanations for coexistence of a given pair of species posit that the two species are either so dissimilar that they compete very little with each other (the niche explanation) or are so similar that they coexist for a long, but not infinite, period of time, with neither able to gain an upper hand (the neutral explanation). Both explanations essentially focus on ecological processes like competition and predation, but in PNAS, Leibold et al. (3) propose a mechanism for coexistence that couples niche and neutral processes together with rapid evolution.

		This research builds from the increasing recognition that evolution is not only a slow process that plays out over geological time but also a rapid process that affects interactions among species from year to year and generation to generation. Daphnia (water fleas) in Lake Constance, Germany, for example, evolved tolerance to a diet with otherwise-harmful cyanobacteria after cyanobacteria became abundant in the 1960s and 1970s (4). This evolution may have helped control toxic algal blooms. Guppies in Trinidadian pools with abundant predators evolved earlier maturity and other life history differences (including altered dietary preferences) that altered ecosystem structure and productivity (5). In part because the impacts of rapid evolution on ecological processes remain challenging to detect, they are likely more important than is widely recognized. Theory is helpful in exploring this relatively blank slate.

		The coexistence model from Leibold et al. (3) is based around two species that occupy a set of habitat patches …

Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches may adapt to local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other preadapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral cooccurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche segregation. Our results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities.},

	abstract     = {A major challenge in ecological research is to identify the tolerance of ecological communities to external perturbations. Modern Coexistence Theory (MCT) has been widely adopted as a framework to investigate the tolerance to perturbations in relative reductions of per capita growth rates, often using metrics that explicitly eliminate the independent role of intrinsic growth rates. More recently, the Structural Approach (SA) was introduced to investigate the tolerance of communities to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates as a function of the strength of intraspecific and interspecific competition. Because the external perturbations are likely to happen in both intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths, no framework alone can fully disentangle the effects of external perturbations. Here we combine MCT and SA to disentangle the tolerance in coexistence and priority effects of a pair of competing species when subject to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths. Through this combination, we reveal the emergence of a key trade-off: increasing the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates typically decreases the tolerance in competition strengths, and vice versa. Furthermore, this trade-off is stronger under coexistence than under priority effects. We test this combined framework on competing pairs of 18 California annual plant species. For both coexistence and priority effects, we find that the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates is maximized instead of that to perturbations in competition strengths in the studied annual plant communities. Synthesis. Our combined framework of MCT and SA illustrates that it is possible to disentangle the impact of different external perturbations on the persistence of species. Importantly, our findings show that species interactions may reveal whether communitiesare dominated either by changes in intrinsic growth rates or competition strengths. Overall, this combined framework can open a new perspective to understand and predict the response of populations to changing environmental conditions.},

Several current debates in biology (for example, over evolution and development, niche construction, cooperation, and the evolution of language) are linked by a common axis of acceptance/rejection of Mayr’s model of causation.

Here, we integrate niche construction explicitly into modern niche theory. We use a graphical approach to analyse how a speciesÕ niche-improving impacts interplay with nichedeteriorating impacts to modify its response to the environment. In a model of two consumers that compete for one limiting resource and one predator, we show how niche construction modiﬁes the traditional nichedeteriorating impacts of its agent or of competing species, and hence the potential for species coexistence. By altering the balance between intraspeciﬁc and interspeciﬁc competitive effects, niche construction can either generate net interspeciﬁc facilitation or strengthen interspeciﬁc competition. The adaptive beneﬁt derived from niche construction also strongly affects the realized niche of a niche-constructing species.},

	abstract     = {Understanding how functional traits moderate species’ demographic responses along environmental gradients is a core pursuit in ecology, often to predict how species abundances will respond to a rapidly changing environment. The latter necessitates species demography, or at least abundance, to be modelled directly as a response; yet, most studies till date use abundance indirectly to calculate and then correlate community-aggregated trait indices to environmental variables, rendering the prediction of species demographic responses along environmental gradients unfeasible. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that stems from joint species distribution modelling, we modelled the recruitments of 53 woody plant species along windstorm-generated environmental gradients from twenty-eight 100-m2 tropical secondary forest plots censused over 5 years in Singapore, and then examined whether environmental responses across species can be explained and generalized by functional traits. We found that species recruitment along the light-availability gradient was moderated by wood density, in that low wood-density species responded more positively to elevated light conditions by being more responsive in height growth. Seed mass moderated species recruitment along the leaf litter depth gradient, such that large-seeded species with greater energy reserves recruited more in sites with thicker leaf litter depths than small-seeded species. Shorter- and taller-statured species recruited more in historically short- and tall-canopied forest sites, respectively, indicating an influence from surrounding parent trees and the importance of considering dispersal limitation in successional studies. Leaf economic traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content and lamina thickness) did not moderate recruitment responses across environments, suggesting a weak role of leaf traits during the earlier life stages or their high plasticity. Synthesis. Wood density, seed mass and adult stature are the main traits that moderate sapling recruitment in our wind-generated forest gaps. The roles of multiple traits in moderating the shared environmental responses across species may be crucial in the maintenance of coexistence and diversity through niche partitioning. Most importantly, we estimated the strength and direction of trait effects on species responses to environmental changes during succession. These are potentially generalizable results that can directly predict the demographic responses of any species—given its traits—to environmental changes.},

	abstract     = {Biological invasions represent both an increasingly important applied problem and a tool for gaining insight into the structure of ecological communities. Although competitive interactions between invasive and native species are considered among the most important mechanisms driving invasion dynamics, such interactions are in general poorly understood. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a widespread and economically important invader long suspected to competitively suppress many native bee species. Yet the extent to which this introduced species alters native communities remains controversial, reflecting ongoing debate over the importance of resource competition in regulating pollinator populations. I experimentally tested the effects of competition with Apis on colony foraging behavior and reproductive success of a native eusocial bee, Bombus occidentalis Greene, in coastal California. B. occidentalis colonies located near experimentally introduced Apis hives had lower mean rates of forager return and a lower ratio of foraging trips for pollen relative to nectar. Both male and female reproductive success of B. occidentalis were also reduced with greater proximity to introduced Apis hives. Reproductive success correlated significantly with measures of colony foraging behavior, most strongly with the relative allocation of foraging effort to pollen collection. This pattern suggests that B. occidentalis colonies exposed to competition with Apis experienced increased nectar scarcity and responded by reallocating foragers from pollen to nectar collection, resulting in lowered rates of larval production. These results provide evidence that Apis competitively suppresses a native social bee known to be an important pollinator, with the potential for cascading effects on native plant communities. This work also contributes to a greater understanding of the role competitive interactions play in pollinator communities, particularly for social bees.},

	abstract     = {Bees collect food from flowers that differ in morphology, color, and scent. Nectar-seeking foragers can rapidly associate a flower's cues with its profitability, measured as caloric value or ‘net energy gain,’ and generally develop preferences for more profitable species. If two flower types are equally easy to discover and feed from, differences in profitability will arise from differences in the volume or the sugar concentration of their nectar crops. Although there has been much study of how bees respond to one or the other of these two kinds of nectar variation, few studies have considered both at once. We presented free-foraging bumblebees with two different types of equally rewarding artificial flowers. After a period of familiarization, we made one type more rewarding than the other by increasing its nectar concentration, volume, or both. Bees responded more rapidly to a change in the reward's sugar concentration than to a change in its volume, even if the profitability differences were approximately equal. Sucrose concentration differences (40\% vs. 13\%) caused bees to virtually abandon the more dilute flower type, whether both types offered the same volume (2 μl) or the less concentrated reward offered higher volume (7 μl vs. 0.85 μl). When the two types of flower differed only in nectar volume (7 μl vs. 0.85 μl), the less rewarding type continued to receive 22\% of the visits. We propose three different hypotheses to explain the stronger response of the bees to changes in sugar concentration: (i) their response threshold to sucrose concentration might change; (ii) less time is needed to assess the concentration of a reward than its volume; and (iii) a smaller sample size may be needed for reliable estimation of profitability when flowers differ in concentration.},

The study tested the hypotheses that bumblebees have shorter foraging trips in environments that provide abundant resources than in environments that provide sparse resources, and that shorter foraging trips translate into greater colony growth. 2. Six even-aged Bombus terrestris colonies were established in contrasting resource environments. Three colonies had access to abundant resources (Phacelia tanacetifolia fields with high flower densities), and three colonies were placed in an environment with sparse resources (scattered semi-natural habitats with food plants at lower densities). 3. A total of 870 foraging trips of 220 marked B. terrestris foragers were observed using automated camcorder recordings. 4. The duration of foraging trips was shorter in environments with abundant resources (66 ± 4.6 min) than in environments with sparse resources (82 ± 3.7 min). Within 34 days colonies that had access to abundant resources gained significantly more weight (129 ± 40 g) than colonies foraging on sparse resources (19 ± 7 g). 5. Thus, the spatial distribution and quality of resources at landscape level affected the duration of foraging trips and the colony growth. It was concluded that future conservation schemes need to improve the spatial and temporal availability of resources in agricultural landscapes to counteract the ongoing decline of bumblebees.},

We test the hypothesis that bumblebee foragers can rapidly learn prior information from past experience in two very different experimental environments. In the high‐variance environment (patches of low and high quality), stochastic optimality models predicted that finding rewards should sometimes sharply increase an optimal forager’s tendency to stay in a patch (an incremental response), whereas in the uniform environment, finding rewards should always decrease the tendency to stay (a decremental response). We use Cox regression models to show that, in a matter of hours, bees learned to match both predicted responses, resulting in a reward intake rate that averaged 80\% of the predicted maximum. Following training in either environment, bees’ adaptive behavior carried over to a common test environment, thus confirming the influence of memorized prior information. Although Bayesian foraging by learning is often presumed, this study is the first to clearly isolate the adaptive use of a learned prior expectation. More generally, it highlights the remarkable adaptive plasticity of an important generalist pollinator and agent of selection.},

This review summarizes, for the first time, 15 years of research on the hazards of neonicotinoids to bees including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. The focus of the paper is on three different key aspects determining the risks of neonicotinoid field concentrations for bee populations: (1) the environmental neonicotinoid residue levels in plants, bees and bee products in relation to pesticide application, (2) the reported side-effects with special attention for sublethal effects, and (3) the usefulness for the evaluation of neonicotinoids of an already existing risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds. Although environmental residue levels of neonicotinoids were found to be lower than acute/chronic toxicity levels, there is still a lack of reliable data as most analyses were conducted near the detection limit and for only few crops. Many laboratory studies described lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on the foraging behavior, and learning and memory abilities of bees, while no effects were observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages. The proposed risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds was shown to be applicable to assess the risk for side-effects of neonicotinoids as it considers the effect on different life stages and different levels of biological organization (organism versus colony). Future research studies should be conducted with field-realistic concentrations, relevant exposure and evaluation durations. Molecular markers may be used to improve risk assessment by a better understanding of the mode of action (interaction with receptors) of neonicotinoids in bees leading to the identification of environmentally safer compounds.},

It was discovered in the course of our optimisation program on neonicotinoids started in 1985. Novel variations of the nitroimino-heterocycle of imidacloprid led to 4-nitroimino-1,3,5-oxadiazinanes exhibiting high insecticidal activity. Among these, thiamethoxam (CGA 293433) was identified as the best compound and selected for worldwide development. The compound can be synthesised in only a few steps and high yield from easily accessible starting materials. Thiamethoxam acts by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It exhibits exceptional systemic characteristics and provides excellent control of a broad range of commercially important pests, such as aphids, jassids, whiteflies, thrips, rice hoppers, Colorado potato beetle, flea beetles and wireworms, as well as some lepidopteran species. In addition, a strong preventative effect on some virus transmissions has been demonstrated. Thiamethoxam is developed both for foliar/soil applications and as a seed treatment for use in most agricultural crops all over the world. Low use rates, flexible application methods, excellent efficacy, long-lasting residual activity and favourable safety profile make this new insecticide well-suited for modern integrated pest management programmes in many cropping systems. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry},

Using 15,169 interaction observations, we constructed 16 hybrid herbivore-plant-pollinator networks along an agricultural intensification gradient to explore changes in network structure and robustness to local extinctions. We found that agricultural intensification led to declines in modularity but increases in nestedness and connectance. Notably, network connectance, a structural feature typically thought to increase robustness, caused declines in hybrid network robustness, but the directionality of changes in robustness along the gradient depended on the order of local species extinctions. Our results not only demonstrate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on hybrid network structure, but they also provide unexpected insights into the structure-stability relationship of hybrid networks.},

	abstract     = {1 Despite ongoing concerns and controversy over a putative ‘global pollination crisis’ there is little information on the response of bees, the most important group of pollinators, to land-use change. In particular, there are no published studies of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire bee communities. 2 We examined bee community responses to forest fragment size, shape, isolation and landscape context (forest variables) by sampling foraging bees at ground level using aerial netting within, and in pastures adjacent to, 22 forest fragments ranging in area from c. 0·25 ha to 230 ha, in southern Costa Rica. We sampled each site 13 times in total, in both wet and dry seasons. 3 Although there were no effects of forest variables on bee diversity and abundance, we did find strong changes in bee community composition. In particular, tree-nesting meliponines (social stingless bees) were associated with larger fragments, smaller edge:area ratios and greater proportions of forest surrounding sample points, while introduced Apis showed opposite patterns. 4 Community composition was also strikingly different between forests and pastures, despite their spatial proximity. In forests, even in the smallest patches, meliponines comprised a much larger proportion of the apifauna, and orchid bees (euglossines) were common. In pastures, Apis was much more abundant and no euglossine bees were found. 5 These results agree broadly with other studies that have found contrasting responses to habitat fragmentation from different bee groups. Conserving meliponine bees, important for pollination of coffee and other crops, and euglossine bees, critical in long-distance pollen transport, will require forest. 6 Synthesis and applications. In the first study of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire understorey bee assemblages, we found bee community resilience to land-use change, as deforested sites and small forest fragments can have a diverse component of bees. While bees as a whole show some degree of resilience to land-use change, there are taxon-specific responses and, in our study area, there is clear value to conserving native forest, particularly for the ecologically and economically important meliponine and euglossine bees.},

	abstract     = {Ecosystem services are critical to human survival; in selected cases, maintaining these services provides a powerful argument for conserving biodiversity. Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this “free” service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.},

Where feasible, accurate characterization of interaction strength can shift the theory of multispecies communities from identifying the vast range of possibilities to isolating the most likely possibilities. To derive generality in our understanding of interaction strengths, however, they must be placed within a unified framework, a framework that can be applied to empirical situations. In this paper we first identify four different theoretical concepts of interaction strength prevalent in the literature (community matrix, Jacobian matrix, inverse Jacobian, and removal matrix), showing how they are related to each other and how they are derived. We also demonstrate that their behavior is not necessarily concordant; hence it is important to identify clearly which concept of interaction strength is being discussed. Then we evaluate several observational and experimental approaches to estimating interaction strength empirically, highlighting their ties to theory, if any, and the limitations and strengths of each approach. Finally, we apply several techniques to a simulated data set, based on an intertidal community, evaluating both accuracy and logistical ease of these approaches. We find that per capita interaction strength is often the most useful index to measure, that caution must be exercised in interpreting empirical estimates of interaction strength because of equilibrium assumptions and the potential confounding effect of indirect effects, and that concentrating on evaluating the relationship between empirically observed rates of change and species abundances may be a profitable way to proceed.},

Theory suggests that ratio dependence is consistent with many food web patterns left unexplained by the simplest prey-dependent models. However, for logistical reasons, ratio dependence and predator dependence more generally have seen infrequent empirical evaluation and then only so in specialist predators, which are rare in nature. Here we develop an approach to simultaneously estimate the prey-specific attack rates and predator-specific interference (facilitation) rates of predators interacting with arbitrary numbers of prey and predator species in the field. We apply the approach to surveys and experiments involving two intertidal whelks and their full suite of potential prey. Our study provides strong evidence for predator dependence that is poorly described by the ratio dependent model over manipulated and natural ranges of species abundances. It also indicates how, for generalist predators, even the qualitative nature of predator dependence can be prey-specific.},

How these trophic interaction modifications (TIMs) interact with one another to produce a net modifying effect is an important but under-explored issue. 2. We review several specific types of TIMs that are well understood to address whether the magnitude of the net modification changes with the number of modifiers, and whether modifiers usually increase or decrease each other’s effects. 3. Modifications of interactions are generally not independent. It is likely that TIMs interact antagonistically in the majority of cases; the magnitudes of TIMs decrease as more modifiers are added, or new TIMs reduce the magnitudes of modifications that are already present. 4. Individual modifications are likely to have a smaller effect in many-species systems than expected from independent combination of modifications measured in systems with relatively few species. Thus, models that lack explicit TIMs may in some cases yield adequate predictions for species-level perturbations, provided that the net effects of TIMs are implicitly included in measured interaction strengths. 5. Many types of TIMs share structural similarities. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of their effects may require theory that distinguishes different ‘functional groups’ of modifiers and addresses how these are structured according to trophic relationships.},

Empirical methods that measure the per capita strengths of trophic species interactions offer a means to identify keystone species and bridge mathematical models and data to synthesize our knowledge of population dynamics and predator feeding behaviors. Many such methods have been proposed, but few have seen independent validation of their estimates or underlying assumptions. This is particularly so with respect to the nonlinear functional responses by which predators often respond to their prey. Here I describe an empirical test of a recently proposed observational method for estimating the nonlinear strength of predator–prey interactions in the field. By applying the method to two populations of a predatory intertidal whelk, Haustrum scobina, I estimated its per capita attack rates on all nine of its observed prey species. These spanned two orders of magnitude in per capita strength. Concurrent experimental manipulations of the two predator populations provided population time series for the response of a mussel prey species, Xenostrobus pulex. I obtained independent interaction strength estimates for this focal interaction by fitting a sequence of hypothesized predator–prey models to these time series. Overall, site-specific models assuming linear functional responses performed better than all others. A direct comparison of the attack-rate estimates from the observational method with those of the best-performing nonlinear model nevertheless revealed high concordance between the two methods. The results of this study therefore support the use of the observational method in larger and more complex food webs and suggest that trophic interactions in the range of mean prey densities observed in nature are approximately linear.},

Here, we computationally assess how adaptive foraging (AF) behaviour interacts with network architecture to determine the stability of plant–pollinator networks. We find that AF reverses negative effects of nestedness and positive effects of connectance on the stability of the networks by partitioning the niches among species within guilds. This behaviour enables generalist pollinators to preferentially forage on the most specialised of their plant partners which increases the pollination services to specialist plants and cedes the resources of generalist plants to specialist pollinators. We corroborate these behavioural preferences with intensive field observations of bee foraging. Our results show that incorporating key organismal behaviours with well-known biological mechanisms such as consumer-resource interactions into the analysis of ecological networks may greatly improve our understanding of complex ecosystems.},

	abstract     = {Global change may substantially affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning but little is known about its effects on essential biotic interactions. Since different environmental drivers rarely act in isolation it is important to consider interactive effects. Here, we focus on how two key drivers of anthropogenic environmental change, climate change and the introduction of alien species, affect plant–pollinator interactions. Based on a literature survey we identify climatically sensitive aspects of species interactions, assess potential effects of climate change on these mechanisms, and derive hypotheses that may form the basis of future research. We find that both climate change and alien species will ultimately lead to the creation of novel communities. In these communities certain interactions may no longer occur while there will also be potential for the emergence of new relationships. Alien species can both partly compensate for the often negative effects of climate change but also amplify them in some cases. Since potential positive effects are often restricted to generalist interactions among species, climate change and alien species in combination can result in significant threats to more specialist interactions involving native species.},

Multivariate regression solutions for each week of observation accounted for 38 to 61\% of the variation in density for B. flavifrons and 47 to 87\% for B. rufocinctus. Temperature or time of day consistently accounted for the most variation in density of the two species. In early summer meadow size or elevation also accounted for a large proportion of explained variation in B. flavifrons density; as the summer progressed meadow floristics increasingly contributed to the explanation of variation in both species. In mid- to late summer a statistically significant portion of the variation in densities not explained by habitat characteristics was accounted for by densities of congeners: i.e., densities of B. flavifrons and B. rufocinctus were negatively related in eight meadows where they co-occurred. In experimental meadows where all Bombus but one of the two target species were removed. B. rufocinctus underwent significant positive density compensation but B. flavifrons did not. To the extent that B. flavifrons appeared to limit the density of B. rufocinctus these statistical and experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis that competition limits local bumblebee densities.},

However, a missed component of biodiversity loss that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the extinction of ecological interactions. Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points. Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the ‘health’ of ecosystems depends.},

Global declines in pollinator diversity and abundance have been recognized, raising concerns about a pollination crisis of crops and wild plants. However, experimental evidence for effects of pollinator species diversity on plant reproduction is extremely scarce. We established communities with 1–5 bee species to test how seed production of a plant community is determined by bee diversity. Higher bee diversity resulted in higher seed production, but the strongest difference was observed for one compared to more than one bee species. Functional complementarity among bee species had a far higher explanatory power than bee diversity, suggesting that additional bee species only benefit pollination when they increase coverage of functional niches. In our experiment, complementarity was driven by differences in flower and temperature preferences. Interspecific interactions among bee species contributed to realized functional complementarity, as bees reduced interspecific overlap by shifting to alternative flowers in the presence of other species. This increased the number of plant species visited by a bee community and demonstrates a new mechanism for a biodiversity–function relationship (“interactive complementarity”). In conclusion, our results highlight both the importance of bee functional diversity for the reproduction of plant communities and the need to identify complementarity traits for accurately predicting pollination services by different bee communities.},

Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.},

In this article, we review the evidence for interspecific competition for partners within mutualist guilds in both plant‐pollinator and ant‐myrmecophyte systems. We then review evidence for the operation of different coexistence mechanisms within these guilds and discuss how the dynamics of competition and coexistence may be uniquely shaped by multispecies mutualist interactions. In particular, we note that adaptive and plastic responses by mutualists to variation in partner quality are likely to play an important role in determining these dynamics. We summarize by considering the ecological conditions that are likely to restrict or promote species coexistence within mutualist guilds. We suggest that these guilds may provide powerful model systems for exploring multiple mechanisms of species coexistence, and we discuss how these mechanisms may be modified by evolutionary adaptation.},

	abstract     = {Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (λ-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators.},

Competition was found in 90\% of the studies and 76\% of their species, indicating its pervasive importance in ecological systems. Exploitative competition and interference competition were apparent mechanisms about equally often. Few experiments showed year-to-year variation in the existence of competition, though more did in its intensity; many were not long-term. The Hairston-Slobodkin-Smith hypothesis concerning variation in the importance of competition between trophic levels was strongly supported for terrestrial and freshwater systems. In particular, producers, and granivores, nectarivores, carnivores, and scavengers taken together, showed more competition than did phytophagous herbivores and filter feeders. In marine systems, virtually no trend was detectable one way or the other. Large heterotrophs competed more than small ones in most comparisons, and other properties possibly deterring predation, such as stinging behavior, seemed also characteristic of species competing frequently. Among terrestrial plants and certain terrestrial animals but not all, experiments carried out in enclosures were more likely to show competition than unenclosed experiments. A greater ecological overlap implied a greater tendency to compete, as determined experimentally, when niche dimensions were food type or microhabitat; the opposite was true for macrohabitat. A substantial number of studies showed asymmetry in their species' response to competition; larger species were significantly more often superior than smaller ones, though a variety of other apparent reasons for asymmetry also existed. The integration of competition theory into field experimentation has only just begun.},

Most assessments of impact rely on correlational data or other indirect measures. Yet few studies have evaluated invasion effects using multiple, simultaneously applied monitoring and experimental approaches, in order to compare easily obtained metrics with more difficult but direct measures of reproductive success or population dynamics. In this study, I use data from an experimental test of introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera) impacts on native bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to address two major questions: 1) how well did observational data on niche overlap and spatial correlations between Apis and Bombus predict the results of experimental tests of competitive effects? and 2) how well did effects of the experimental Apis manipulations on Bombus foragers, which are easy to observe, predict changes in reproductive success of colonies, which are difficult to measure? Niche overlap between Apis and Bombus varied substantially, but increased to levels as high as 80–90\% during periods of resource scarcity. Correlations between numbers of Apis foragers and numbers of Bombus foragers were also highly variable, but I detected a significant negative relationship in only one of the seven months observed. In contrast, the experimental results showed that mean numbers of Bombus foragers observed on a given transect increased significantly with greater distance from introduced Apis colonies. Of these three measures (niche overlap, correlations in abundances, and effects of experimental introductions), only the experimental data on forager abundances accurately estimated competitive effects on colony reproductive success previously reported for the same experiment, and the correlational data in particular completely failed to predict the effects observed in the experimental study. This work suggests that great caution is warranted in making assessments of invasion impact on the basis of spatial or temporal correlations between invasive and native species. Thus, investing in even small and limited experimental studies may be more valuable than extensive observational work in quantifying invasion impacts.},

	abstract     = {The feasibility domain of an ecological community can be described by the set of environmental abiotic and biotic conditions under which all co-occurring and interacting species in a given site and time can have positive abundances. Mathematically, the feasibility domain corresponds to the parameter space compatible with positive (feasible) solutions at equilibrium for all the state variables in a system under a given model of population dynamics. Under speciﬁc dynamics, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is a necessary condition for species persistence regardless of whether the feasible equilibrium is dynamically stable or not. Thus, the size of the feasibility domain can also be used as an indicator of the tolerance of a community to random environmental variations. This has motivated a rich research agenda to estimate the feasibility domain of ecological communities. However, these methodologies typically assume that species interactions are static, or that input and output energy ﬂows on each trophic level are unconstrained. Yet, this is different to how communities behave in nature. Here, we present a step-by-step quantitative guideline providing illustrative examples, computational code, and mathematical proofs to study systematically the feasibility domain of ecological communities under changes of interspeciﬁc interactions and subject to different constraints on the trophic energy ﬂows. This guideline covers multitrophic communities that can be formed by any type of interspeciﬁc interactions. Importantly, we show that the relative size of the feasibility domain can signiﬁcantly change as a function of the biological information taken into consideration. We believe that the availability of these methods can allow us to increase our understanding about the limits at which ecological communities may no longer tolerate further environmental perturbations, and can facilitate a stronger integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

In the past decades, much effort has been devoted to infer the importance of a particular structure by its capacity to tolerate an external perturbation on its structure or dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that such a perspective leads to inconsistent conclusions. That is, the importance of a network structure changes as a function of the external perturbations acting on a community at any given point in time. Thus, we discuss a research agenda to investigate the relative importance of the structure of ecological networks under an environment-dependent framework. We hypothesize that only by studying systematically the link between network structure and community dynamics under an environment-dependent framework, we can uncover the limits at which communities can tolerate environmental changes.},

	abstract     = {Bombus terrestris bumblebees are important pollinators of wild flowers, and in modern agriculture they are used to guarantee pollination of vegetables and fruits. In the field it is likely that worker bees are exposed to pesticides during foraging. To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food.},

Simulation models of pollination networks suggest that plant communities will be resilient to losing many or even most of the pollinator species in an ecosystem. These predictions, however, have not been tested empirically and implicitly assume that pollination efficacy is unaffected by interactions with interspecific competitors. By contrast, ecological theory and data from a wide range of ecosystems show that interspecific competition can drive variation in ecological specialization over short timescales via behavioral or morphological plasticity, although the potential implications of such changes in specialization for ecosystem functioning remain unexplored. We conducted manipulative field experiments in which we temporarily removed single pollinator species from study plots in subalpine meadows, to test the hypothesis that interactions between pollinator species can shape individual species’ functional roles via changes in foraging specialization. We show that loss of a single pollinator species reduces floral fidelity (short-term specialization) in the remaining pollinators, with significant implications for ecosystem functioning in terms of reduced plant reproduction, even when potentially effective pollinators remained in the system. Our results suggest that ongoing pollinator declines may have more serious negative implications for plant communities than is currently assumed. More broadly, we show that the individual functional contributions of species can be dynamic and shaped by the community of interspecific competitors, thereby documenting a distinct mechanism for how biodiversity can drive ecosystem functioning, with potential relevance to a wide range of taxa and systems.},

On successive flower-head visits in depleted areas they moved more forward than backward (82\% vs. 18\%), while in rich areas they tended to move almost as much backward as forward 47\% vs. 53\%).4.The distances of inter-head moves were approximately twice as long in depleted as in rich areas.5.The bees visited almost as many florets per unit time in the rich as in the depleted areas (32 vs. 35 per min). But in the rich patches they probed on the average into 11.6 florets per head in contrast to only 2.3 florets per depleted head.6.In an experiment with B. vagans workers foraging from Aconitum napellus inflorescences, the bees did not reject previously visited flowers, and they moved upward in successive flower visits on inverted as well as on unaltered inflorescences. On horizontal inflorescences they moved both right and left. The movements are not a direct response to nectar differences, nor to differences in average nectar distributions. The systematic foraging behavior on vertical inflorescences may thus be a mechanism of reducing the revisiting of just-emptied flowers.},

In addition to direct mortality induced by pesticides, their sublethal effects on arthropod physiology and behavior must be considered for a complete analysis of their impact. An increasing number of studies and methods related to the identification and characterization of these effects have been published in the past 15 years. Review of sublethal effects reported in published literature, taking into account recent data, has revealed new insights into the sublethal effects of pesticides including effects on learning performance, behavior, and neurophysiology. We characterize the different types of sublethal effects on beneficial arthropods, focusing mainly on honey bees and natural enemies, and we describe the methods used in these studies. Finally, we discuss the potential for developing experimental approaches that take into account these sublethal effects in integrated pest management and the possibility of integrating their evaluation in pesticide registration procedures.},

We examined mean thorax widths (a reliable measure of body size) of workers of Bombus pascuorum, B. lucorum, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris at sites with and without honeybees.

Instead, bumblebee densities were positively related to the availability of highly rewarding mass flowering crops (i.e. oilseed rape) in the landscape. In addition, mass flowering crops were only effective determinants of bumblebee densities when grown extensively at the landscape scale, but not at smaller local scales.

	abstract     = {Bees are generally regarded as beneficial insects for their role in pollination, and in the case of the honeybee Apis mellifera, for production of honey. As a result several bee species have been introduced to countries far beyond their home range, including A. mellifera, bumblebees (Bombus sp.), the alfalfa leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata, and various other solitary species. Possible negative consequences of these introductions include: competition with native pollinators for floral resources; competition for nest sites; co-introduction of natural enemies, particularly pathogens that may infect native organisms; pollination of exotic weeds; and disruption of pollination of native plants. For most exotic bee species little or nothing is known of these possible effects. Research to date has focused mainly on A. mellifera, and has largely been concerned with detecting competition with native flower visitors. Considerable circumstantial evidence has accrued that competition does occur, but no experiment has clearly demonstrated long-term reductions in populations of native organisms. Most researchers agree that this probably reflects the difficulty of carrying out convincing studies of competition between such mobile organisms, rather than a genuine absence of competitive effects. Effects on seed set of exotic weeds are easier to demonstrate. Exotic bees often exhibit marked preferences for visiting flowers of exotic plants. For example, in Australia and New Zealand many weeds from Europe are now visited by European honeybees and bumblebees. Introduced bees are primary pollinators of a number of serious weeds. Negative impacts of exotic bees need to be carefully assessed before further introductions are carried out.},

The behavior of the parasitoids has been recorded with a video-computerized system. The analysis of the behaviors in control conditions versus exposed to an LD 20 have shown that both insecticides significantly increased the arrestment of parasitoids by kairomones. This increase was not followed up by a modification of the kinetics of the behavior. In both control and exposed conditions, parasitoids regularly increased their residence time on the kairomone patch indicating that no saturation to kairomones had occurred. In a field situation where hosts could be scarce, this increase in arrestment could be advantageous for parasitoids by increasing their host finding.},

	abstract     = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food.},

Strong similarities among the floral displays of different plant species, paired with high variability in reward distributions across time and space, can weaken correlations between floral signals and reward status. As a result, it should be difficult for foragers to discriminate between rewarding and rewardless flowers. Building on signal detection theory in behavioural ecology, we use hypothetical probability density functions to examine graphically how plant signals pose challenges to forager decision-making. We argue that foraging costs associated with incorrect acceptance of rewardless flowers and incorrect rejection of rewarding ones interact with community-level reward availability to determine the extent to which rewardless and rewarding species should overlap in flowering time. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of these phenomena from both the forager and the plant perspectives.

Bees foraging in these competitive vacuums probed more flowers per inflorescence than control bees. One bee's foraging was studied intensively before and after its local competitors were removed. Compared to four nestmates foraging elsewhere, the focal bee's trip times were shorter (p{\textless}0.005) and its food collection rate was marginally higher (P= 0.064) during the removal, although all the bees foraged similarly before the removal.

	abstract     = {With ongoing global pollinator declines it is important to understand the functional impact of pollinator species losses. While network-based simulation models of pollinator declines predict that plant communities will be robust to losses of pollinator species, these predictions have never been tested empirically. In four chapters, my dissertation uses both empirical and modeling approaches to explore the impacts of losing pollinator species in alpine plant communities. First, I test the hypothesis that interspecific interactions among pollinators (rather than fixed species roles) dynamically alter the functional contribution of species in a community and that these dynamic roles can sometimes reduce plant reproductive function. Experimental removal of the most abundant bumble bee pollinator species from an alpine bumblebee community led to a reduction in floral fidelity in the remaining pollinators. Importantly, this behavioral response in the remaining pollinators reduced plant reproduction by increasing the transfer of ineffective heterospecific pollen. Second, I evaluate how patterns of naturally deposited heterospecific pollen relate to the reproductive output of Delphinium barbeyi, a common subalpine perennial herb in the Rocky Mountains. I found a significant negative interaction between conspecific pollen and the amount of heterospecific pollen whereby the relationship between conspecific pollen and viable seed production became weaker with increasing heterospecific pollen deposition on stigmas.Third, I explore how traits—specifically pollinator tongue length, which dictates pollinator resource partitioning—influences how pollinators responded to reduced interspecific competition. I found that bees vary in their baseline floral fidelity and that their tongue length explained a large part of this variation. Bees with shorter tongues moved between plant species (floral infidelity) more often than bees with longer tongues. I did not find significant variation in how bee species responded to reduced interspecific competition, but rather saw a guild-wide reduction in floral fidelity in response to the removal of the dominant bee species. Interestingly, I found that competitive context determines the floral fidelity of the pollinators in a community. In this case, as the tongue length of the most abundant bee increases, the site level foraging fidelity decreases. Network model simulations predict plant populations will be resilient when faced with pollinator extinctions. Importantly, these models are built on the assumption that all interactions in network are positive, potentially overestimating the resilience of plant-pollinator networks. A wide range of studies (including my field work) have shown that many pollinators are actually ineffective at pollinating plant species they visit, and can therefore have negative consequences for plant reproduction. Fourth, I used interaction network simulations to understand how the addition of negative interactions impacts the predictions of resilience when plant communities are faced with pollinator species losses. I found that the addition of negative interactions makes networks less robust to pollinator extinctions, but not always in the same way. This work suggests metrics specific to interaction networks may be important in determining how robust plant-pollinator interactions are to extinctions. Finally I provide overview on some of the causes and consequences of pollinator decline in the US and offer insight in to how my basic research into pollinator ecology can help pinpoint vulnerable species and communities that should be targeted for conservation efforts.},

Traditional \${\textbackslash}widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles.

The changes in population density depend on the manner in which the per capita rate of increase of each species is moulded by the population densities of both species. (2) Results of a competition experiment on two winter-annual species of grass, Phleum arenarium and Vulpia fasciculata, are given; the experiment included wide ranges of densities of both species, so that the dependence of their per capita rates of increase on population density could be determined. This contrasts with traditional plant competition experiments that either hold the density of one species constant while varying the other (additive experiments), or hold the sum of both densities constant while varying the proportion (substitutive experiments). (3) Eight models of competition were fitted to the data. A satisfactory fit was achieved only when a model with density-dependent competitive abilities and non-linear isoclines was used. This model predicts the outcome of competition both qualitatively (eradication of P. arenarium) and quantitatively (the changes in population density through time from given initial values) with assumed seed mortality rates. (4) In contrast, additive competition experiments provide no information about the long-term outcome of competition, and substitutive experiments provide qualitative information only. These qualitative insights may themselves be misleading if an inappropriate density is chosen for the substitutive experiment.},

	abstract     = {Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition, the shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g., nutritional prey are harder to capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species. This intransitivity allows for coexistence if, along its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of the rare genotypes or species. By affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence, while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic contributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary storage effect. Density dependence and mutations also promote coexistence. These results highlight how the efficacy of evolution as a coexistence mechanism may depend on the underlying genetic architecture.},

Classical theory has shown that evolution is equally responsive to selection on females and males, with natural selection increasing the product of the average relative fitness of each sex over time. This simple rule underlies several important predictions regarding the maintenance of genetic variation, the genetic basis of adaptation, and the dynamics of “sexually antagonistic” alleles. Nevertheless, theories of sex-specific selection overwhelmingly focus on evolution in constant environments, and it remains unclear whether they apply under changing conditions. We derived four simple models of sex-specific selection in variable environments and explored how conditions of population subdivision, the timing of dispersal, sex differences in dispersal, and the nature of environmental change mediate the evolutionary dynamics of sex-specific adaptation. We find that these dynamics are acutely sensitive to ecological, demographic, and life-history attributes that vary widely among species, with classical predictions breaking down in contexts of environmental heterogeneity. The evolutionary rules governing sex-specific adaptation may therefore differ between species, suggesting new avenues for research on the evolution of sexual dimorphism.},

These self-effects are known as 'self-regulation' when an increase in a species’ abundance decreases its per-capita growth rate. Sources of self-regulation include intraspecific interference, cannibalism, time-scale separation between consumers and their resources, spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear functional responses coupling predators with their prey. The influence of self-regulation on network stability is understudied and in addition, the empirical estimation of self-effects poses a formidable challenge. Here, we show that empirical food web structures cannot be stabilized unless the majority of species exhibit substantially strong self-regulation. We also derive an analytical formula predicting the effect of self-regulation on network stability with high accuracy and show that even for random networks, as well as networks with a cascade structure, stability requires negative self-effects for a large proportion of species. These results suggest that the aforementioned potential mechanisms of self-regulation are probably more important in contributing to the stability of observed ecological networks than was previously thought.},

The criticisms concern three main issues: the definition of standardized environmental and interaction parameters; the definition of comparison quotients and the meaning of their non-uniqueness; and the status of the theory when there are at least as many limiting factors as species in the system. He makes many important observations, and the provision of his own derivation of the theory gives a unique perspective on what elements of the theory are deemed important and why. Additionally, Chesson (2019) mentions in passing several elements of our review which he believes are not handled well. However, we argue that the differences between Chesson’s (2019) account of the theory and ours are overstated, turning out to be differences of emphasis and interpretation, rather than fundamental mistakes.

Each view implies different spatiotemporal community patterns. Along spatial environmental gradients, the organismic view predicts that species turnover is discontinuous, with sharp boundaries between communities, while the individualistic view predicts gradual changes in species composition. Using a spatially explicit multispecies competition model, we show that organismic and individualistic forms of community organisation are two limiting cases along a continuum of outcomes. A high variance of competition strength leads to the emergence of organism-like communities due to the presence of alternative stable states, while weak and uniform interactions induce gradual changes in species composition. Dispersal can play a confounding role in these patterns. Our work highlights the critical importance of considering species interactions to understand and predict the responses of species and communities to environmental changes.},

The experimental sites were chosen to encompass most of the floristic diversity observed along gradients of elevation and topography, which are the two main ecological gradients associated with alpine plant communities in the western Alps. The effects of neighbor removal on the survival, aboveground biomass, and reproduction of five target species were tested at each of six experimental sites. Using biomass data, we calculated relative competitive index (RCI) and log response ratio (LRR) as measures of interaction strength and direction. We found highly significant shifts from strong competitive effects in low and sheltered sites to strong facilitative responses in high and exposed sites. When experimental results were integrated with gradient analyses, we found that the responses of particular alpine plant species to neighbor removal generally depended on the species' position on elevational and topographical gradients. When neighbors were removed from around target species at experimental sites that were lower in elevation than the distributional mean of the target species, biomass generally increased. When neighbors were removed from around target species at experimental sites that were higher in elevation than the distributional mean of the target species, biomass decreased. In other words, facilitation appeared to allow species from lower elevations to move up the gradient, but competition at low elevations appeared to restrict species from higher elevations from moving down the gradient. In high and exposed sites, experimental evidence for facilitation was coupled to small-scale spatial associations among species, but spatial disassociation was not coupled to experimental evidence for competition at any sites. We conclude that the distribution and abundance of many species in high-elevation communities of the western Alps appears to be enhanced by neighbors, and that species continua commonly observed along environmental gradients are the result of both negative and positive plant interactions.},

It is also embedded in a highly dynamic environment and can be easily destabilised by environmental changes, invasive species, and human activity.

In this study we introduce a simple conceptual model for this joint ecosystem, which demonstrates that the interaction between tidal flooding and habitat elevation is able to produce an ecotone with similar characteristics to that observed in empirical studies. In particular, the transition from mud flat to vegetated state is locally abrupt, occurring at a critical threshold elevation, but, on broader spatial scales can occur over a range of elevations determined by the variability in high tide water levels. Additionally, the model shows the potential for regime shifts, resulting from periods of unusual weather or the invasion of a fast growing, or flood resistant, species.},

The possibility that ecotones arise from ecological niche construction by ecosystem engineers has received little attention. In this study, we investigate how the diversity of ecosystem engineers, and their interactions, can give rise to ecotones. We build a spatially explicit dynamical model that couples a multispecies community and its abiotic environment. We use numerical simulations and analytical techniques to determine the biotic and abiotic conditions under which ecotone emergence is expected to occur, and the role of biodiversity therein. We show that the diversity of ecosystem engineers can lead to indirect interactions through the modification of their shared environment. These interactions, which can be either competitive or mutualistic, can lead to the emergence of discrete communities in space, separated by sharp ecotones where a high species turnover is observed. Considering biodiversity is thus critical when studying the influence of species–environment interactions on the emergence of ecotones. This is especially true for the wide range of species that have small to moderate effects on their environment. Our work highlights new mechanisms by which biodiversity loss could cause significant changes in spatial community patterns in changing environments.},

Here we map the question of the number of different possible SUs a community can support to the geometric problem of finding maximal cliques of the corresponding graph. This enables us to solve for the number of SUs as a function of the species richness in the regional pool, N, showing that the growth of this number is subexponential in N, contrary to long-standing wisdom. To understand the dynamics under noise we examine the relaxation time to an SU. Symmetric systems relax rapidly, whereas in asymmetric systems the relaxation time grows much faster with N, suggesting an excitable dynamics under noise.},

However quantitative predictive tools are vital for understanding the fate of ecological communities. Here we derive an analytical approximation for predicting the relative yield total (or equivalently the mean relative yield) as a function of the mean intensity of the interspecific competition and the species richness. The rationale is that with incomplete information on model parameters it seems more reasonable to attempt to predict “macroscopic” or mean quantities, defined for the whole community of competing species, rather than making detailed “microscopic” predictions, like species abundances. This method, with only a fraction of the model parameters (carrying capacities and competition coefficients), is able to predict accurately empirical measurements covering a wide variety of taxa −algae, plants, protozoa, etc. Our aim with this approach is to contribute in making community ecology a more quantitative and predictive science. We argue that such parsimonious modeling is preferable than more realistic/complex theories involving additional parameters which can be very difficult to measure.},

	abstract     = {Abstract: In selected foraging habitats of an agricultural landscape flower visits of bumblebees and community structure of foraging bumblebees were studied, with special regard to the role of crops as super-abundant resources. Most crops represent temporal foraging habitats with high abundance of bumblebees but mainly with low diversity in the bumblebee forage community, in contrast to permanent foraging habitats such as, for example, a hedgerow. The high numbers of bumblebees in the monoculture of crop plantations consisted mainly of short-tongued bumblebee species. The role of foraging distances for the visitation rate of foraging habitats was studied by performing capture–recapture experiments with natural nests of Bombus terrestris, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus muscorum. Differences were found on the species as well as the individual level. The foraging distances of B. muscorum were more restricted to the neighbourhood of the nesting habitat than the foraging activity of B. terrestris and B. lapidarius. High percentages of B. terrestris workers were recaptured while foraging on super-abundant resources in distances up to 1750 m from the nest. Isolated patches of highly rewarding forage crops, in agricultural landscapes, are probably only accessed by bumblebee species with large mean foraging distances, such as the short-tongued B. terrestris. Species like the rare, long-tongued B. muscorum depend on a close connection between nesting and foraging habitat. A restricted foraging radius might be one important factor of bumblebee species loss and potential pollinator limitation in modern agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, long-distance flights of bumblebee pollinators have to be considered in the present discussion on gene flow from transgenic plant species on a landscape scale.},

Visitation rates by bumble bees, the principal pollinators, were then observed. In the reward-variation experiments, bees appeared to learn the positions of nectar-rich shoots, and visited them significantly more often than nectar-poor shoots. They did not respond to similar variation in pollen production. The nectar preferences developed slowly after the treatments were imposed, and bees continued to favor sites that had been occupied by nectar-rich shoots even after the treatments were discontinued. Visitation rate was approximately proportional to flower number, making it unlikely that increases in inflorescence size produced a disproportionate gain in male reproductive success (a necessary condition in certain models for the evolution of dioecy). For a fixed number of flowers per inflorescence, bees preferred inflorescences with more umbels. In pairwise choice tests of male-phase and female-phase umbels of various sizes, bees preferred male-phase umbels and larger umbels; the preference for male-phase umbels is stronger in bees that had previously fed on male-phase umbels.},

	abstract     = {1 Most animals have to bridge some distances in space and time to provide all resources necessary for survival. Little is known about how the local and regional management of tropical agroforestry systems, differing in the availability of food resources and suitable nesting sites, determine foraging trip duration and density of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera Aculeata). 2 In this study, foraging trip duration and brood-cell density (in trap nests exposed for a 15-month period) were analysed for three species, which represent three guilds in 24 agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia): the pollinator Heriades sp. aff. fulvescens (Apidae), the cacao caterpillar-hunting predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale umeroatrum (Eumenidae) and the spider-hunting predator Auplopus levicarinatus (Pompilidae). The agroforestry systems were characterized by plant species richness, blossom cover of herbs, light intensity and distance from the nearest natural forest. 3 The correlation of foraging time to bee and wasp density showed the relative importance of food and nest-site availability for the pollinator and the spider-hunting predator, because both parameters are correlated with light intensity in the agroforestry systems. In contrast, foraging time and nest density of the eumenid predator were not correlated because of the distance between high quantities of food resources (in sites with dense cacao plants) and nesting sites (in adjacent natural forests). 4 The eumenid response to local and regional agroforestry management illustrates that species may survive only in landscapes that permit access to a multiple set of resources. Accordingly, habitat evaluations using only foraging time may lead to wrong conclusions, as key drivers of population dynamics may not be inside but outside the local systems, emphasizing the need for a landscape approach.},

An increasing number of studies ask whether resources limit pollinator populations, using field measurements of reproductive success, time series and models. Findings generally support positive effects of floral resources, but also highlight the potential importance of nest site availability and parasitism. In parallel, recent experiments strengthen evidence that competition reduces access to floral resources. Developing common currencies for quantifying floral resources and integrating analyses of multiple limiting factors will further strengthen our understanding of competitive interactions and their effects in the Anthropocene.},

It differs in allowing the populations to show damped oscillations, stable cycles or even apparent “chaos” if competition is sufficiently severe. A similar two age-class model is discussed where there is both intra- and interspecific competition in one of the developmental stages, but only intraspecific competition in the other. Even this slight increase in complexity leads to markedly different properties. The zero growth curves become nonlinear and up to three equilibria between two competing species are possible.},

A model to describe the pattern of mortality in high density populations is also discussed with particular reference to the nature of intraspecific competition within plant populations. A reparameterized version of a reciprocal equation proposed by Bleasdale \& Nelder is used to describe the relationship between individual plant weight and surviving plant density. The biological interpretation of the parameters is discussed in relation to the dry matter production of isolated plants, the density at which mutual interference between neighbours becomes appreciable, and the efficiency of resource utilization at high densities. The reparameterized equation is then used together with an equation which describes mortality during self-thinning as the basis for a new model to describe the relation between total plant yield and sowing density. The law of allometry is used in conjunction with the model to describe the relationship between the weight of a plant part and density, and this then forms the basis for a model of the population dynamics of annual plants with effectively discrete generations. Finally the dynamical behaviour of plant populations is discussed. It is concluded that most plant populations will show neighbourhood stability with exponential or perhaps oscillatory damping towards an equilibrium.},

We show how May's celebrated “stability criterion” can be derived using random matrix theory, and how extensions of the so-called circular law for the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues of large random matrix can further our understanding of ecological systems. Our goal is to present the more technical material in an accessible way, and to provide pointers to the primary mathematical literature on this subject.

Our goal is to understand the effects of diversity, interaction strengths and ecological network structure on the volume of parameter space leading to feasible equilibria. We develop a geometrical framework to study the range of conditions necessary for feasible coexistence. We show that feasibility is determined by few quantities describing the interactions, yielding a nontrivial complexity–feasibility relationship. Analysing more than 100 empirical networks, we show that the range of coexistence conditions in mutualistic systems can be analytically predicted. Finally, we characterize the geometric shape of the feasibility domain, thereby identifying the direction of perturbations that are more likely to cause extinctions.},

Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.},

In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic \${\textbackslash}textbackslashwidehat\{R\}\$ of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional \${\textbackslash}textbackslashwidehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

	abstract     = {Foragers can improve search efficiency, and ultimately fitness, by using social information: cues and signals produced by other animals that indicate food location or quality. Social information use has been well studied in predator–prey systems, but its functioning within a trophic level remains poorly understood. Eavesdropping, use of signals by unintended recipients, is of particular interest because eavesdroppers may exert selective pressure on signaling systems. We provide the most complete study to date of eavesdropping between two competing social insect species by determining the glandular source and composition of a recruitment pheromone, and by examining reciprocal heterospecific responses to this signal. We tested eavesdropping between Trigona hyalinata and Trigona spinipes, two stingless bee species that compete for floral resources, exhibit a clear dominance hierarchy and recruit nestmates to high-quality food sources via pheromone trails. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry of T. hyalinata recruitment pheromone revealed six carboxylic esters, the most common of which is octyl octanoate, the major component of T. spinipes recruitment pheromone. We demonstrate heterospecific detection of recruitment pheromones, which can influence heterospecific and conspecific scout orientation. Unexpectedly, the dominant T. hyalinata avoided T. spinipes pheromone in preference tests, while the subordinate T. spinipes showed neither attraction to nor avoidance of T. hyalinata pheromone. We suggest that stingless bees may seek to avoid conflict through their eavesdropping behavior, incorporating expected costs associated with a choice into the decision-making process.},

Tentative generalizations about evolutionary processes across species are beginning to emerge, as well as contrasting patterns that characterize different groups of organisms. Furthermore, recent technical advances now allow the combination of ecological measurements of selection in natural environments with population genetic analysis of cloned QTLs, promising advances in identifying the evolutionary processes that influence natural genetic variation.},

In such systems, mate choice has been hypothesised to benefit females genetically. For the genetic benefits to be possible there must be additive genetic variation (VA) for sexual ornaments, such that highly ornamented males can pass fitter genes on to the progeny of choosy females. Here, I review the mechanisms that can contribute to the maintenance of this variation. The variation may be limited to sexual ornaments, resulting in Fisherian benefits in terms of the increased reproductive success of male progeny produced by choosy females. Alternatively, ornaments may capture VA in other life-history traits. In the latter case, “good genes” benefits may apply in terms of improved performance of the progeny of either sex. Some mechanisms, however, such as negative pleiotropy, sexually antagonistic variation or overdominance, can maintain VA in ornaments and other life-history traits with little variation in total fitness, leaving little room for any genetic benefits of mate choice. Distinguishing between these mechanisms has consequences not only for the theory of sexual selection, but also for evolution of sex and for biological conservation. I discuss how the traditional ways of testing for genetic benefits can usefully be supplemented by tests detecting benefits resulting from specific mechanisms maintaining VA in sexual ornaments.},

Quantitative genetics is viewed as the bridge between complex mathematical models of trait evolution and real-world data, and the authors have clearly framed their treatment as such. This is the second volume in aplanned trilogy that summarizes the modern field of quantitative genetics, informed by empirical observations from wide-ranging fields (agriculture, evolution, ecology, and human biology) as well as population genetics, statistical theory, mathematical modeling, genetics, and genomics. Whilst volume 1 (1998)dealt with the genetics of such traits, the main focus of volume 2 is on their evolution, with a special emphasis on detecting selection (ranging from the use of genomic and historical data through to ecological field data) and examining its consequences.},

Historically, there has been skepticism about the potential of temporal variation to balance polymorphism, because selection must be strong to have a meaningful stabilizing effect—unless dominance also varies over time (“reversal of dominance”). Here, we develop a simplified model of seasonally variable selection that simultaneously incorporates four different stabilizing mechanisms, including two genetic mechanisms (“cumulative overdominance” and reversal of dominance), as well as ecological “storage” (“protection from selection” and boom-bust demography). We use our model to compare the stabilizing effects of these mechanisms. Although reversal of dominance has by far the greatest stabilizing effect, we argue that the three other mechanisms could also stabilize polymorphism under plausible conditions, particularly when all three are present. With many loci subject to diminishing returns epistasis, reversal of dominance stabilizes many alleles of small effect. This makes the combination of the other three mechanisms, which are incapable of stabilizing small effect alleles, a better candidate for stabilizing the detectable frequency oscillations of large effect alleles.},

It is found that a species may persist provided only that it is favored sufficiently by the environment during favorable periods independently of the extent to which the other species is favored during its favorable periods.Coexistence is defined in terms of the stochastic boundedness criterion for species persistence. Using the lottery model as an example this criterion is justified and compared with other persistence criteria. Properties of the stationary distribution of population density are determined for an interesting limiting case of the lottery model and these are related to stochastic boundedness. An attempt is then made to relate stochastic boundedness for infinite population models to the behavior of finite population models.},

	abstract     = {In deterministic approaches to modeling, two species are generally regarded as capable of coexistence if the model has a stable equilibrium with both species in positive numbers. Temporal environmental variability is assumed to reduce the likelihood of coexistence by keeping species abundances away from equilibrium. Here we present a contrasting view based on a model of competition for space among coral reef fishes, or any similarly territorial animals. The model has no stable equilibrium point with both species in positive abundance, yet both species persist in the system provided environmental variability in birth rates is sufficiently high. In general the higher the environmental variability the more likely it is that coexistence will occur. This conclusion is not affected by one species having a mean advantage over the other. Not all kinds of environmental variability necessarily lead to coexistence, however, for when the death rates of the two species are highly variable and negatively correlated, the extinction of one species, determined by chance, is likely to occur. The results in this paper are shown to depend on the nonlinearity of the dynamics of the system. This nonlinearity arises from the simple fact that the animals have overlapping generations. When applied to the coral reef fish setting, our analysis confirms the view that coexistence can occur in a system where space is allocated largely at random, provided environmental variability is sufficiently great (Sale 1977); but our explanations and predictions differ in detail with those of Sale.}
